    <p>Hello, world! As many of you probably know, this is the customary output of the first program one writes when learning a new computer programming language. This is the first piece of writing I am putting out on the Internet, with the exception of Facebook “notes” and Myspace posts from a past I’m decidedly putting behind me. I’ve always been pretty skeptical of blogging, since it can come off as self-indulgent or irrelevant. However, in the past few years, I’ve seen another side of blogging, as certain blogs have delivered wisdom about fellowship and grad school applications, answered questions about obscure programming errors, and helped me indulge niche fascinations. Blog posts that are well-written, insightful and concise are a useful and interesting corner of the Internet, and that’s what I’ll be striving for here.</p>

    <p>I thought I’d include a few of my favorite blogs and posts here for reference and as an example of what I’m going for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://kellyjstoner.wordpress.com/fulbright/advice-for-applicants/" target="_blank">Kelly Stoner's Fulbright Application Advice</a>: I seriously wish I'd seen this *before* I applied for a Fulbright; Kelly's post does a great job of distilling and emphasizing the most important advice for Fulbright research applications</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.secondavesagas.com/" target="_blank">Second Avenue Sagas</a>: Ben Kabak's incredibly snarky, thorough and consistent blog on NYC transit</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.citylab.com/" target="_blank">City Lab</a>: Formerly the Atlantic Cities, this blog puts out quick pieces on all things city-related, often with maps</li>
      <li><a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/" target="_blank">Smitten Kitchen</a>: The most beautiful, well-organized, hilarious and reliable cooking blog I've ever used</li>
    </ul>
