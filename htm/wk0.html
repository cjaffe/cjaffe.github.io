    <p>Even though I have spent all summer jotting down potential How To Make (HTM) project ideas, I naturally decided to think up something completely different during an early-morning (!) brainstorming session. Hopefully this will not be a recurring theme for the course... This content does not exist yet, but someday there will be a detailed description of the many things I'm learning!!! There will be lots of text. Lots of text. Lots and lots of text. Lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of text.</p>

    <p>There will also be lots of pretty professional looking photos documenting my process.</p>

    <p>This is just a dummy page that I built so that I have a template for what project pages look like, so that I don't have to scramble to build something once the fall arrives. </p>
