<h2 class="header htm">The Odd Keepon Out: Using Robots to Examine How Group Size Affects Perceptions of an Outgroup Member</h2>
<h3 class="centered date">New Haven, CT - Spring 2012</h3>

    <p>During my junior year of college, I took a human-robot interaction course that culminated in a month-long robotics research project and final presentation. Two classmates and I wanted to understand how group size impacts perceptions of “outgroup” members. We wanted to model these groups with robots, because robot behavior can be controlled and replicated across many trials, but faced a major challenge in cost. Instead, we reverse-engineered a toy robot – a $20 version of a research-grade robot – so that we could easily scale group size. To gain control of the robot’s servo motors, we used an oscilloscope to monitor the signals passed to motors. We were able to decipher the digital messaging protocol and program the robot with customized actions. With control over the robot’s motors, we conducted an experiment where we asked participants to rate the skill and likeability of a robot with unique actions in groups of different size. We found that perceptions of the individual robot’s talent grew stronger as group size increased; this result has important implications about dynamics in the classroom, on athletic teams, and in professional settings.

                            This project set an example of overcoming cost constraints in robotics research by reverse-engineering toy robots. Our work has evolved into a cheap, open-source robotics platform with accompanying tutorials. Versions of these “hacked” robots have been presented at the World Science Fair in New York City and exhibited at AAAI and CogSci, flagship research conferences in artificial intelligence and cognitive science. This project encouraged me to think deeply about how scientific research can be used to understand human behavior and was a course-related opportunity to apply technology to human issues.
