<P>
The purpose of this project is to provide intelligent, personalized fitness feedback in an accessible and engaging form. Many personal fitness trackers have some limited data analysis functionality. They stream data to a web application and present some rudimentary graphs that show the user's activity over the past week. While these web applications offer a valuable start, this project aims to make better use of the data by understanding what forms of coaching or encouragement give rise to such data and using that understanding to influence the user's fitness behavior.

Broadly, this project uses Machine Learning techniques to distinguish between intentional and incidental fitness activities, as recorded by FitBit, a portable and personalized fitness tracker. Intentional activites include those where the user has decided to go on a run or undertake a period of sustained exercise. These periods are usually marked by consistently high step and calorie counts. Incidental activity is that where the user is walking to work, class or around the home, and is marked by lower step counts and more eratic activity patterns. The user's activity is compared to their activity history; the system then selects a behavior such as "congratulate" or "reprimand" from a library of actions, and sends those actions to an embodied robot. For this project, I used the Aldebaran Nao robot, because it was easily programmable and of an appropriate size for a personal embodied robot. Though the scope of my project did not include human testing, the objective of my project was to create a project that would effectively engage users and successfully influence their behavior so that they exercised more.
