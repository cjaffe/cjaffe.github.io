	      <div class="modal-body">
	       In November, I attended Generation Citizen’s Civic Tech Challenge. Generation Citizen is a nationwide non-profit group that empowers teenagers to engage in politics and civic activity. During the 8-hour Civic Tech Challenge hackathon, we built a tool to help young activists decide how and where to allocate their problem-solving energy. Our team prototyped a web application that would connect participants with similarly minded people, educational material, and actionable opportunities to get involved. Screenshots of the basic flow can be seen below.
<br><br>
On the first page, users are prompted to enter a statement about their concern or issue. On the second page, users see other statements related to the issue. We extracted keywords from each user’s statement and used these to tag and categorize the statements. Users can filter results using different keywords or find other users in a certain area. On the right-hand side, users can discover relevant action items or educational material about the issue they’ve entered. Our project won the hackathon’s Usability Award for ease of use, intuitiveness, and appeal to a young generation of users. Though we just completed a prototype at the hackathon, we are planning to continue work on this project at Code for Boston hack nights.

	      </div>
	      <div class="modal-body">
	        After graduating from Yale, I spent a year researching urban cycling behavior as a Fulbright Fellow at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) in the Netherlands. I used computational data analysis to learn about urban bicycling, a successful form of mobility in the Netherlands – 27% of all trips are made by bicycle! – but one that faces growing pains in the U.S., where cycling comprises less than 1% of trips.
<br><br>
Building upon work done by my Dutch colleagues, I investigated the attitudes, emotions and motivations that surround an individual’s decision to cycle or not. Environmental factors are important, but research suggests that less tangible factors, like the way a community perceives cyclists or a person’s habits, can have equal impact. To study these factors, I collected Twitter data and analyzed it using Naive Bayes sentiment analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling. My investigation was aimed at both deciphering the way people feel about bicycling and evaluating social media analysis as a research method for understanding transit habits. I found that cycling sentiment is highly bimodal. Discussion centers around high-profile issues, both positive (e.g. new bike lanes) and negative (e.g. dangerous cycling behavior), that capture the attention of cycling advocates and detractors. While I faced challenges in establishing the reliability and representativeness of Twitter data, social media analysis proved an exciting technique that offered real-time access to opinions richer and more direct than those collected in traditional transportation research. My findings, which reflected on the possibilities and challenges of using social media analysis to better understand cycling motivations, were gathered in a paper that I am preparing to submit to the international journal Transportation.

	      </div>
	      <div class="modal-body">
	        I have been working as a software engineer for three months at Fitbit, a company that makes wearable devices that enable users to track step, calorie and stair counts, as well as map exercise routes and measure heart rate. Fitbit’s work relates closely to my interest in analyzing human dynamics and tackles public health issues by encouraging users to exercise more and make healthy choices. 
<br><br>
In addition to being a Fitbit employee and a long-time Fitbit user myself, Fitbit devices were a key component of my senior thesis in college. For this project, which I designed and executed independently, I collected annotated activity data from several friends, and used it to train a Random Forests classifier to understand when a user was intentionally exercising (e.g. by going on a run) or merely increasing their step count incidentally (e.g. by walking to class). Using this model of user behavior, I programmed an Aldebaran Nao humanoid robot to communicate and coach the user, with the idea that an embodied presence can give rise to more significant changes in a user’s behavior. Through these interactions, I sought to present the robot as a social presence who understood the context of a user’s life and exercise habits. One of the greatest barriers to successful personal fitness tracker usage has been durable engagement; usage diminishes as the excitement of the new product wears off. With the embodied presence of a social robot, I hoped that the insights available from the fitness tracker data would continue to seem relevant and that users would stay engaged with the system.

	      </div>
	      <div class="modal-body">
	        After spending a summer commuting in the Bay Area and experiencing first-hand the shortcomings of the area’s public transportation systems, I was interested in learning about the area’s transit history and thinking about how these systems could be made more accessible and useful. I used the final project of a GIS class as an opportunity to explore possibilities for expansion. I learned that when the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) was originally conceived in the 1950s, planners visualized a transit system that would encircle the Bay. For various reasons, only a fraction of the system was implemented and today, BART connects a wide swath of the East Bay with just a sliver of Southeastern San Francisco and parts of the peninsula. While the system itself is relatively reliable, fast and cheap, it is weakened by its minimal coverage in San Francisco and bulky interface with other transit systems.
<br><br>
For my analysis, I collected data on population, traffic and job density, city topography, and existing public transportation systems, and integrated this information using GIS map algebra to optimize the placement of new branches of the BART system in San Francisco.

	      </div>
	      <div class="modal-body">
	        For an independent engineering project, a classmate and I developed a custom sonar ranging system for a quadcopter drone. Our goal was to build a system that would allow the drone to follow and avoid a wall, with the idea that we could eventually extend this behavior for tasks like searching, following, transporting, monitoring or leading. This project required the integration of several disciplines and techniques, including hardware for the sensing system and wireless communication, and software for writing the drone’s control algorithms. The sensing system consisted of two sonar sensing modules mounted on a rotating servo motor that produced a distance reading. Based on this reading, we used our control algorithm to set the pitch, roll and yaw values to allow the drone to maintain constant distance from a wall. These values were communicated wirelessly to the Linux system controlling the drone and sent to the drone using its built-in SDK. 

     
        <br><br>

Through our calibrations and testing, we produced a set of parameters for our control algorithm that allowed the drone to successfully follow and avoid a wall, staying within 0.5 to 2m. This project laid important groundwork for other useful projects involving quadcopters and was an instructive opportunity for hands-on hardware work.
