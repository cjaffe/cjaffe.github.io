<h2 class="header htm">Using a Sonar Ranging System to Develop Autonomous Wall-Following for a Quadcopter</h2>
<h3 class="centered date">New Haven, CT - Fall 2012</h3>

    <hr>
    <p>For an independent engineering project, a classmate and I developed a custom sonar ranging system for a quadcopter drone. Our goal was to build a system that would allow the drone to follow and avoid a wall, with the idea that we could eventually extend this behavior for tasks like searching, following, transporting, monitoring or leading. This project required the integration of several disciplines and techniques, including hardware for the sensing system and wireless communication, and software for writing the droneâ€™s control algorithms. The sensing system consisted of two sonar sensing modules mounted on a rotating servo motor that produced a distance reading. Based on this reading, we used our control algorithm to set the pitch, roll and yaw values to allow the drone to maintain constant distance from a wall. These values were communicated wirelessly to the Linux system controlling the drone and sent to the drone using its built-in SDK.

                            Through our calibrations and testing, we produced a set of parameters for our control algorithm that allowed the drone to successfully follow and avoid a wall, staying within 0.5 to 2m. This project laid important groundwork for other useful projects involving quadcopters and was an instructive opportunity for hands-on hardware work.
