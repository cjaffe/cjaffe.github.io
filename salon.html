    <h3>Salon #14 - 6/3/15</h3>
    <p>Though a slightly haphazard setting with the couch and red chair gone, we had a lovely happy group. Zoe read a fantastic Hemingway fairytale/ parable about a fighting bull from a feminist storybook called "The Outspoken Princess and The Gentle Knight" (which I will definitely be reading to my future children). Then, Caroline J. read an essay called "Mission and Metrics" from her advisor, Sep Kamvar's, essay book. We discussed how bad metrics can sometimes be antithetical to the purpose and goals of different organizations, cited examples, and pondered how to fix the metrics problem. Next time we (may) break from the regular salon schedule for a summer picnic, and to tearfully say goodbye to all the people departing for new cities, and then we'll be back the following time with our regular programming.</p>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #16 - 8/10/15</h3>
    <p>Zoe shared two poems on loss, forgetfulness, and memory: One Art by Elizabeth Bishop and Forgetfulness by Billy Collins. We discussed the tight-knit relationship betwen these concepts. Does forgetting knowledge or facts constitute a loss? How does forgetfulness play into the processing and closure of an emotional loss? Joy then gave a presentation on the renewable energy industry - we learned about the different financing schemes and about her specific role as an analyst at Next Step Living.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #17 - 9/21/15</h3>
    <p>Zoe shared another beautiful and thought-provoking art experience with us. She showed Bruegel's Landscape with the Fall of Icarus, and read two poems that meditate on the painting: Landscape with the Fall of Icarus by William Carlos Williams and Musee des Beaux Arts by WH Auden. We discussed how we process others' suffering, and how it is hard for people outside our fields to process the striving/ falling experienced in a very narrow, deep and specific discipline. Kim led us through a fun, challenging and enlightening drawing experience where we did blind contour drawings with partners. We learned a bit about her artistic process and her experience as a scientific illustrator. Ani also shared some of her project ideas from How To Make (Almost) Anything! Great way to get back into Salon after a bit of a break...looking forward to the fall!</p>

    <h3>Salon #18 - 10/7/15</h3>
    <p>Zoe read a <a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/09/11/the-most-misread-poem-in-america/" target="_blank">hilarious and insightful essay</a> from the Paris Review about Robert Frost's often misinterpreted poem, "The Road Not Taken". The piece deconstructs the outsize popularity of the poem, as well as its meaning. Here is a representative quote: <br><br>"Most readers consider “The Road Not Taken” to be a paean to triumphant self-assertion (“I took the one less traveled by”), but the literal meaning of the poem’s own lines seems completely at odds with this interpretation. The poem’s speaker tells us he “shall be telling,” at some point in the future, of how he took the road less traveled by, yet he has already admitted that the two paths “equally lay / In leaves” and “the passing there / Had worn them really about the same.” So the road he will later call less traveled is actually the road equally traveled. The two roads are interchangeable.

According to this reading, then, the speaker will be claiming “ages and ages hence” that his decision made “all the difference” only because this is the kind of claim we make when we want to comfort or blame ourselves by assuming that our current position is the product of our own choices (as opposed to what was chosen for us or allotted to us by chance). The poem isn’t a salute to can-do individualism; it’s a commentary on the self-deception we practice when constructing the story of our own lives."<br><br>
Ariel then gave a fantastic presentation on Bitcoin and Blockchain technology. We learned about transaction validation protocol, the public ledger, Bitcoin mining, other uses for Blockchain technology, and more. It was the most coherent and interesting explanation of Bitcoin I've ever heard - thank you Ariel!</p>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #19 - 10/21/15</h3>
    <p>Caroline shared some readings about the conflict between construction and preservation in New York City. Even though old buildings and beautiful and charming, they tend to be low-rise buildings that accomodate fewer people than buildings built using modern building technologies. One idea is that favoring construction over preservation would allow cities to become more affordable and inclusive. On the other hand, some super-tall but super-expensive apartment buildings are being built using tricks like FAR trading. Some developers are able to fulfill their requirement to build low-income housing in crafty ways that are not necessarily true to the spirit of inclusive neighborhood policy. We also discussed how a city should decide what to save and what deserves to be preserved. Courtney then gave a great presentation about her experience as a chess champion! We learned about tournament play and discussed the treatment/ experience of women in the chess world. We learned about why Courtney started (and stopped) playing, and how she occasionally brings out her skills nowadays to keep people on their toes! She also brought a few fun chess puzzles that we practiced solving.</p>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #20 - 11/5/15</h3>
    <p>A great, jovial salon group! Jenny read a funny and thought-provoking Gloria Steinem piece called <a href="http://ww3.haverford.edu/psychology/ddavis/p109g/steinem.menstruate.html" target="_blank">If Men Could Menstrate</a>, which discussed the gendered power justifications surrounding menstration (or lack thereof). We also discussed periods more generally, and the way menstruation is dealt with in relationships and professional settings. Katherine then gave a fascinating presentation on the chemical composition of different body washes, cleansers and shampoos. We learned about the different surfactants (i.e. the compounds that actually clean you) in different mixtures, as well as the compounds that affect the texture or viscosity of a fluid. We also learned about how lather, and how bars of soap, because they generally have such a high pH, can dry out your skin even though they generate a really creamy lather. Katherine worked for Dove (at Unilever) and told us about the chemistry that differentiates Dove products. In particular, she developed a Dove body wash with a high concentration of petroleum that is very mosturizing. Finally, we got to test a bunch of different cleansers - putting our new knowledge to use!</p>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #21 - 11/18/15</h3>
    <p>Another great, big group! Zoe brought and read Arthur Miller's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/11/12/specials/miller-common.html" target="_blank">Tragedy and the Common Man</a>, and we discussed tragedy, both in the academic/ literary sense, and as a way of processing the current violence and tragedy that is happening globally. In particular, we discussed if/ how the literary definition of tragedy (an exalted figure who is brought down by a tragic flaw) can be reconciled with our more colloquial understanding of tragedy. Then, Shirlee gave a fantastic introduction to and explanation of CRISPR-cas9, a new gene editing technology which is taking the world by storm. This is a potentially revolutionally new technology that could have major implications for healthcare, ethics, and beyond. Researchers found that a certain bacterial gene locus which had a pattern of repeating segments (e.g., the CRISPRs) interspersed with other sequences of bases (say, "NNNN") could match with, and cut, that pattern "NNNN" in another gene. This bacteria brings in the cas9 proteins which are able to do the actual cutting. Then, the CRISPR sequence, with interspersed patterns provides a template for the gene to repair itself against. This is how a gene can be edited - both additively and subtractively! The CRISPR sequences and interspersed patterns are synthesized; the patterns are synthesized to match certain sequences in actual DNA. Shirlee gave a great presentation that made the information accessible on multiple levels! </p>

    <h3>Salon #22 - 12/2/15</h3>
    <p>A rainy day and a cozy group. Zoe (champion of salon readings!) brought and read a Jack Gilber poem called <a href="http://thesunmagazine.org/issues/451/a_brief_for_the_defense" target="_blank">A Brief for the Defense</a>, which discusses the appropriate response to seeing tragedy and horror in the world (an all-too-apt topic of conversation these days). The conversation touched on some of the same issues as last week; we discussed feelings of helplessness, guilt, and being overwhelmed. With the poem, we came to the conclusion that it is not productive to be consumed by guilt and sorrow; we must live our lives and experience joy while staying aware of tragedy and sorrow. After this discussion, Aviva gave an information-packed presentation on her giant fruit sticker collection (8000+ distinct fruit and veggie stickers!) and about how fruit labeling works and the international fruit shipping industry. She also gave us an in-depth explanation of hybrid breeding works in the case of the Pluot, and spoke about the two family farms that are the main pluot distributors. We also started an interesting discussion on GMO crops, which will hopefully be continued in the future!</p>
