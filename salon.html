<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #14 - 6/3/15</h3>
    <p>Though a slightly haphazard setting with the couch and red chair gone, we had a lovely happy group. Zoe read a fantastic Hemingway fairytale/ parable about a fighting bull from a feminist storybook called "The Outspoken Princess and The Gentle Knight" (which I will definitely be reading to my future children). Then, Caroline J. read an essay called "Mission and Metrics" from her advisor, Sep Kamvar's, essay book. We discussed how bad metrics can sometimes be antithetical to the purpose and goals of different organizations, cited examples, and pondered how to fix the metrics problem. Next time we (may) break from the regular salon schedule for a summer picnic, and to tearfully say goodbye to all the people departing for new cities, and then we'll be back the following time with our regular programming.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon Outing - 6/17/15</h3>
    <p>Six of us ventured out of Cambridge to attend one of the Boston Public Library's "Concerts in the Courtyard". The band was <a href="http://www.chorobop.org/">ChoroBop</a>, a fantastic group of 3 Brazilian Berklee students who played a mix of choro and jazz. The courtyard was a beautiful, serene setting. Afterwards, we ate a lively dinner at nearby Casa Romero.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">

</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #16 - 8/10/15</h3>
    <p>Zoe shared two poems on loss, forgetfulness, and memory: One Art by Elizabeth Bishop and Forgetfulness by Billy Collins. We discussed the tight-knit relationship betwen these concepts. Does forgetting knowledge or facts constitute a loss? How does forgetfulness play into the processing and closure of an emotional loss? Joy then gave a presentation on the renewable energy industry - we learned about the different financing schemes and about her specific role as an analyst at Next Step Living.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #17 - 9/21/15</h3>
    <p>Zoe shared another beautiful and thought-provoking art experience with us. She showed Bruegel's Landscape with the Fall of Icarus, and read two poems that meditate on the painting: Landscape with the Fall of Icarus by William Carlos Williams and Musee des Beaux Arts by WH Auden. We discussed how we process others' suffering, and how it is hard for people outside our fields to process the striving/ falling experienced in a very narrow, deep and specific discipline. Kim led us through a fun, challenging and enlightening drawing experience where we did blind contour drawings with partners. We learned a bit about her artistic process and her experience as a scientific illustrator. Ani also shared some of her project ideas from How To Make (Almost) Anything! Great way to get back into Salon after a bit of a break...looking forward to the fall!</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #18 - 10/7/15</h3>
    <p>Zoe read a <a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/09/11/the-most-misread-poem-in-america/" target="_blank">hilarious and insightful essay</a> from the Paris Review about Robert Frost's often misinterpreted poem, "The Road Not Taken". The piece deconstructs the outsize popularity of the poem, as well as its meaning. Here is a representative quote: <br><br>"Most readers consider “The Road Not Taken” to be a paean to triumphant self-assertion (“I took the one less traveled by”), but the literal meaning of the poem’s own lines seems completely at odds with this interpretation. The poem’s speaker tells us he “shall be telling,” at some point in the future, of how he took the road less traveled by, yet he has already admitted that the two paths “equally lay / In leaves” and “the passing there / Had worn them really about the same.” So the road he will later call less traveled is actually the road equally traveled. The two roads are interchangeable.

According to this reading, then, the speaker will be claiming “ages and ages hence” that his decision made “all the difference” only because this is the kind of claim we make when we want to comfort or blame ourselves by assuming that our current position is the product of our own choices (as opposed to what was chosen for us or allotted to us by chance). The poem isn’t a salute to can-do individualism; it’s a commentary on the self-deception we practice when constructing the story of our own lives."<br><br>
Ariel then gave a fantastic presentation on Bitcoin and Blockchain technology. We learned about transaction validation protocol, the public ledger, Bitcoin mining, other uses for Blockchain technology, and more. It was the most coherent and interesting explanation of Bitcoin I've ever heard - thank you Ariel!</p>
</div>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #19 - 10/21/15</h3>
    <p>Caroline shared some readings about the conflict between construction and preservation in New York City. Even though old buildings and beautiful and charming, they tend to be low-rise buildings that accomodate fewer people than buildings built using modern building technologies. One idea is that favoring construction over preservation would allow cities to become more affordable and inclusive. On the other hand, some super-tall but super-expensive apartment buildings are being built using tricks like FAR trading. Some developers are able to fulfill their requirement to build low-income housing in crafty ways that are not necessarily true to the spirit of inclusive neighborhood policy. We also discussed how a city should decide what to save and what deserves to be preserved. Courtney then gave a great presentation about her experience as a chess champion! We learned about tournament play and discussed the treatment/ experience of women in the chess world. We learned about why Courtney started (and stopped) playing, and how she occasionally brings out her skills nowadays to keep people on their toes! She also brought a few fun chess puzzles that we practiced solving.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #20 - 11/5/15</h3>
    <p>A great, jovial salon group! Jenny read a funny and thought-provoking Gloria Steinem piece called <a href="http://ww3.haverford.edu/psychology/ddavis/p109g/steinem.menstruate.html" target="_blank">If Men Could Menstrate</a>, which discussed the gendered power justifications surrounding menstration (or lack thereof). We also discussed periods more generally, and the way menstruation is dealt with in relationships and professional settings. Katherine then gave a fascinating presentation on the chemical composition of different body washes, cleansers and shampoos. We learned about the different surfactants (i.e. the compounds that actually clean you) in different mixtures, as well as the compounds that affect the texture or viscosity of a fluid. We also learned about how lather, and how bars of soap, because they generally have such a high pH, can dry out your skin even though they generate a really creamy lather. Katherine worked for Dove (at Unilever) and told us about the chemistry that differentiates Dove products. In particular, she developed a Dove body wash with a high concentration of petroleum that is very mosturizing. Finally, we got to test a bunch of different cleansers - putting our new knowledge to use!</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #21 - 11/18/15</h3>
    <p>Another great, big group! Zoe brought and read Arthur Miller's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/11/12/specials/miller-common.html" target="_blank">Tragedy and the Common Man</a>, and we discussed tragedy, both in the academic/ literary sense, and as a way of processing the current violence and tragedy that is happening globally. In particular, we discussed if/ how the literary definition of tragedy (an exalted figure who is brought down by a tragic flaw) can be reconciled with our more colloquial understanding of tragedy. Then, Shirlee gave a fantastic introduction to and explanation of CRISPR-cas9, a new gene editing technology which is taking the world by storm. This is a potentially revolutionally new technology that could have major implications for healthcare, ethics, and beyond. Researchers found that a certain bacterial gene locus which had a pattern of repeating segments (e.g., the CRISPRs) interspersed with other sequences of bases (say, "NNNN") could match with, and cut, that pattern "NNNN" in another gene. This bacteria brings in the cas9 proteins which are able to do the actual cutting. Then, the CRISPR sequence, with interspersed patterns provides a template for the gene to repair itself against. This is how a gene can be edited - both additively and subtractively! The CRISPR sequences and interspersed patterns are synthesized; the patterns are synthesized to match certain sequences in actual DNA. Shirlee gave a great presentation that made the information accessible on multiple levels! </p>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #22 - 12/2/15</h3>
    <p>A rainy day and a cozy group. Zoe (champion of salon readings!) brought and read a Jack Gilbert poem called <a href="http://thesunmagazine.org/issues/451/a_brief_for_the_defense" target="_blank">A Brief for the Defense</a>, which discusses the appropriate response to seeing tragedy and horror in the world (an all-too-apt topic of conversation these days). The conversation touched on some of the same issues as last week; we discussed feelings of helplessness, guilt, and being overwhelmed. With the poem, we came to the conclusion that it is not productive to be consumed by guilt and sorrow; we must live our lives and experience joy while staying aware of tragedy and sorrow. After this discussion, Aviva gave an information-packed presentation on her giant fruit sticker collection (8000+ distinct fruit and veggie stickers!) and about how fruit labeling works and the international fruit shipping industry. She also gave us an in-depth explanation of hybrid breeding works in the case of the Pluot, and spoke about the two family farms that are the main pluot distributors. We also started an interesting discussion on GMO crops, which will hopefully be continued in the future!</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #23 - 1/13/16</h3>
    <p>Everyone seemed to agree that the first salon of the new year (2016!!) was an engaging success! Many thanks to Ariel and Aviva for their reading and presentation (respectively), both of which stoked long conversations that will hopefully be continued outside of salon! Ariel read excerpts from an excellent essay by cryptographer Phillip Rogaway called <a href="http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/moral-fn.pdf" target="_blank">The Moral Character of Cryptographic Work</a>. We discussed the morality and ethics of academic funding, the racial undercurrents of America's survelliance program, and the future of privacy. After this discussion, Aviva gave a fascinating and detailed presentation on the history and science of GMOs. We learned about different types of crop breeding (including the more traditional hybrid breeding and the newer genetic engineering techniques), the testing and regulatory process for GMO crops, and some of the controversies around GMO labeling and production.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #24 - 1/27/16</h3>
    <p>We kicked off this week's salon with some fun catch-up and a discussion of names (hyphenated last names, anybody?). Courtney brought in an opinion piece that argued that you shouldn't look for work "that you love", but that you should instead find a practical job that pays your bills, and spend your free time doing what you love. We discussed the merits of this idea, and whether or not we had grown up in an environment that prioritized profitability over fulfillment (or vice versa). We also discussed how the pressure to "do what you love" may be especially pronounced for our generation and among graduates of elite universities. Finally, we returned to the perennially difficult and interesting discussion of how to balance a career and family - child care? Living close to one's parents? A partner who believes in equal responsiblities? This conversation took us to nearly 10pm, so we decided to postpone the speaker presentation until next time!</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #25 - 2/10/16</h3>
    <p>This week, for the 25th(!) salon, we had special homemade green tea shortbread cookies (baked and decorated by Shirlee and Aviva - thank you!), and a new "tea bar". Fun updates! Miranda read a funny and pointed NYT Op-Ed titled <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/opinion/the-eight-second-attention-span.html?_r=0">The Eight-Second Attention Span</a>. The piece discussed how smartphones and media have weakened our ability to pay attention or think deeply. We spoke of meditative techniques and practices (like gardening or pottery), and also discussed how the phenomenon of short attention spans may contribute to the tumultuous and soundbyte-driven quality of the current presidential campaign. After this discussion (and a brief consideration of "should I support Hillary because I'm female?"), Chelsea engaged us in a challenging and interesting discussion about effective altruism. The challenges of effective altruism include figuring out how best to deploy funds to better humanity and measure/ quantify the impact of your donations. We discussed how it is difficult to fully understand the effects of international development efforts (e.g. malaria nets being used in overfishing), and also whether or not the potential of Artificial Intelligence represents a real/ true/ present threat to humanity that should be mitigated through fundraising and donations.</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #26 - 2/24/16</h3>
    <p>Another big, lively salon gathering! Shirlee commented afterwards that salon seems to have taken on new life in the past few months, with larger groups, and conversation that is both casual/ comfortable and lively. I agree with her (and hope you do too!) and thank you for participating in this journey!! The "tea bar" made another appearence this week, along with amazing pumpkin muffins from Katherine and some beautiful flowers from Joy. To kick off the evening, I (Caroline J) read Frederic Laloux's essay: <a href="http://www.strategy-business.com/article/00344?gko=10921" target="_blank">The Future of Management Is Teal</a>. I discovered Laloux by reading his book, Reinventing Organizations, in one of my classes. He discusses different paradigms for organizational management, assigning them color codes that map to different stages of human evolution and consciousness. We had a lively discussion about the relative merits of different management styles and structures, and related our experience with these different styles. Plans were developed to have a follow-up session on leadership/ management styles at the next salon. After this discussion, Zoe gave a fantastic presentation on the quirks and uncertainties of Elizabethan publishing practices, especially regarding Shakespeare's oeuvre and popular misconceptions about its consistency. We learned that the Elizabethan era held very different notions of ownership and authorship. Because anybody could transcribe a play and sell it to a publisher, and because the publishers often (inadvertently) inserted typos or inconsistencies into the quartos and folios they sold, there exist many versions of Shakespeare's plays. This understanding casts new light on the modern practice of close textual analysis; Zoe gave the example of how uncertainty about a single letter in a single word near the end of Othello could lead to radically different interpretations of the play.</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #27 - 3/9/16</h3>
    <p>With twelve people, and a mix of old and new faces, this may have been the biggest salon ever! Courtney shared a two-part, multimedia "reading" about leadership.  She read an HBR article called <a href="https://hbr.org/2008/01/love-and-fear-and-the-modern-boss" target="_blank">Love and Fear and the Modern Boss</a> and shared a portion of <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/sheryl_sandberg_why_we_have_too_few_women_leaders?language=en" target="_blank">Sheryl Sandberg's famous TED talk about why there are so few women leaders</a>. We discussed whether it is better to be loved or feared as a leader, and spoke about our own experiences in leadership positions, as well as our experiences judging other women in leadership positions. We also discussed, more generally, the bias that is inherent in selecting/ promoting leaders. One particularly salient point that came forward was the idea that, even though minorities are often self-conscious about the idea that "affirmative action" helped them reach their current position, people in positions of privilege rarely think about how their privilege allowed them to get to that point. After this discussion, Ani gave a fantastic and thorough presention on how context influences cognition, which in turn influences perception, which in turn mediates reality. She asked us to ponder questions like: "what technologies affect each of these processes, and how do you make art and technologies that both change our physiological perception and make us aware of the context of our perception?" She shared a slideshow of amazing examples of art and technology that attempt to change these perceptive processes, and then let us demo her own creation: a pair of face visors outfitted with cameras that allow you to swap vision with the person wearing the other visor. The experience was both playful and strange!</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #28 - 3/23/16</h3>
    <p>Another lovely evening with a lovely group of people! Since my birthday is on 3/25 (two days after salon), and I was on Spring Break, I decided to do a little baking for this salon. With the generous and savvy help of Shirlee and Aviva, I made two (!!) cakes, using recipes from Smitten Kitchen (the <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2008/10/pink-lady-cake/" target="blank">Pink Lady Cake</a> and the <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2016/01/blood-orange-almond-and-ricotta-cake/#more-17278" target="_blank">Blood Orange, Almond & Ricotta Cake</a>). Mine didn't look quite as pretty, but the consensus was that they were pretty tasty! After taking a few minutes to settle in (read: scrambling to finish the cakes!), Zoe shared a beautiful and thought-provoking poem with us called <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/171611" target="_blank">The Search Party</a> by William Matthews. This was a tricky poem that we read several times; it forced us to question the truth of the poem's narrative and the reliability and intent of the narrator; it also led us to a discussion about the practice and purpose of art and self-reflection. Zoe once again delivered a splendid and insightful reading of the poem - thank you, as always! After this discussion, Snoweria gave a great presentation about a project she is working on for one of her studios at the GSD. As part of this studio, she and her partner are redesigning a waste facility in Stockholm to include an updated waste facility and a mosque (the studio is built around the idea of colocating waste facilities with other public uses). Snoweria walked us through the design of the new facility, and engaged with us in a great conversation about the potentially political nature of architecture and how the narrative of a building can influence its reception and usage. We were all quite impressed by her presentation's beautiful graphics and exciting narrative!</p>
