</div>

<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #14 - 6/3/15</h3>
    <p>Though a slightly haphazard setting with the couch and red chair gone, we had a lovely happy group. Zoe read a fantastic Hemingway fairytale/ parable about a fighting bull from a feminist storybook called "The Outspoken Princess and The Gentle Knight" (which I will definitely be reading to my future children). Then, Caroline J. read an essay called "Mission and Metrics" from her advisor, Sep Kamvar's, essay book. We discussed how bad metrics can sometimes be antithetical to the purpose and goals of different organizations, cited examples, and pondered how to fix the metrics problem. Next time we (may) break from the regular salon schedule for a summer picnic, and to tearfully say goodbye to all the people departing for new cities, and then we'll be back the following time with our regular programming.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon Outing - 6/17/15</h3>
    <p>Six of us ventured out of Cambridge to attend one of the Boston Public Library's "Concerts in the Courtyard". The band was <a href="http://www.chorobop.org/">ChoroBop</a>, a fantastic group of 3 Brazilian Berklee students who played a mix of choro and jazz. The courtyard was a beautiful, serene setting. Afterwards, we ate a lively dinner at nearby Casa Romero.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #15 - 7/1/15</h3>
    <p>Caroline N. read a piece about Vera Wang's various career incarnations; we spoke about career paths and the search for excellence in one's career.

<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon Outing/ Activity - 7/29/15</h3>

</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #16 - 8/10/15</h3>
    <p>Zoe shared two poems on loss, forgetfulness, and memory: One Art by Elizabeth Bishop and Forgetfulness by Billy Collins. We discussed the tight-knit relationship betwen these concepts. Does forgetting knowledge or facts constitute a loss? How does forgetfulness play into the processing and closure of an emotional loss? Joy then gave a presentation on the renewable energy industry - we learned about the different financing schemes and about her specific role as an analyst at Next Step Living.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #17 - 9/21/15</h3>
    <p>Zoe shared another beautiful and thought-provoking art experience with us. She showed Bruegel's Landscape with the Fall of Icarus, and read two poems that meditate on the painting: Landscape with the Fall of Icarus by William Carlos Williams and Musee des Beaux Arts by WH Auden. We discussed how we process others' suffering, and how it is hard for people outside our fields to process the striving/ falling experienced in a very narrow, deep and specific discipline. Kim led us through a fun, challenging and enlightening drawing experience where we did blind contour drawings with partners. We learned a bit about her artistic process and her experience as a scientific illustrator. Ani also shared some of her project ideas from How To Make (Almost) Anything! Great way to get back into Salon after a bit of a break...looking forward to the fall!</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #18 - 10/7/15</h3>
    <p>Zoe read a <a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/09/11/the-most-misread-poem-in-america/" target="_blank">hilarious and insightful essay</a> from the Paris Review about Robert Frost's often misinterpreted poem, "The Road Not Taken". The piece deconstructs the outsize popularity of the poem, as well as its meaning. Here is a representative quote: <br><br>"Most readers consider “The Road Not Taken” to be a paean to triumphant self-assertion (“I took the one less traveled by”), but the literal meaning of the poem’s own lines seems completely at odds with this interpretation. The poem’s speaker tells us he “shall be telling,” at some point in the future, of how he took the road less traveled by, yet he has already admitted that the two paths “equally lay / In leaves” and “the passing there / Had worn them really about the same.” So the road he will later call less traveled is actually the road equally traveled. The two roads are interchangeable.

According to this reading, then, the speaker will be claiming “ages and ages hence” that his decision made “all the difference” only because this is the kind of claim we make when we want to comfort or blame ourselves by assuming that our current position is the product of our own choices (as opposed to what was chosen for us or allotted to us by chance). The poem isn’t a salute to can-do individualism; it’s a commentary on the self-deception we practice when constructing the story of our own lives."<br><br>
Ariel then gave a fantastic presentation on Bitcoin and Blockchain technology. We learned about transaction validation protocol, the public ledger, Bitcoin mining, other uses for Blockchain technology, and more. It was the most coherent and interesting explanation of Bitcoin I've ever heard - thank you Ariel!</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #19 - 10/21/15</h3>
    <p>Caroline shared some readings about the conflict between construction and preservation in New York City. Even though old buildings and beautiful and charming, they tend to be low-rise buildings that accomodate fewer people than buildings built using modern building technologies. One idea is that favoring construction over preservation would allow cities to become more affordable and inclusive. On the other hand, some super-tall but super-expensive apartment buildings are being built using tricks like FAR trading. Some developers are able to fulfill their requirement to build low-income housing in crafty ways that are not necessarily true to the spirit of inclusive neighborhood policy. We also discussed how a city should decide what to save and what deserves to be preserved. Courtney then gave a great presentation about her experience as a chess champion! We learned about tournament play and discussed the treatment/ experience of women in the chess world. We learned about why Courtney started (and stopped) playing, and how she occasionally brings out her skills nowadays to keep people on their toes! She also brought a few fun chess puzzles that we practiced solving.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #20 - 11/5/15</h3>
    <p>A great, jovial salon group! Jenny read a funny and thought-provoking Gloria Steinem piece called <a href="http://ww3.haverford.edu/psychology/ddavis/p109g/steinem.menstruate.html" target="_blank">If Men Could Menstrate</a>, which discussed the gendered power justifications surrounding menstration (or lack thereof). We also discussed periods more generally, and the way menstruation is dealt with in relationships and professional settings. Katherine then gave a fascinating presentation on the chemical composition of different body washes, cleansers and shampoos. We learned about the different surfactants (i.e. the compounds that actually clean you) in different mixtures, as well as the compounds that affect the texture or viscosity of a fluid. We also learned about how lather, and how bars of soap, because they generally have such a high pH, can dry out your skin even though they generate a really creamy lather. Katherine worked for Dove (at Unilever) and told us about the chemistry that differentiates Dove products. In particular, she developed a Dove body wash with a high concentration of petroleum that is very mosturizing. Finally, we got to test a bunch of different cleansers - putting our new knowledge to use!</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #21 - 11/18/15</h3>
    <p>Another great, big group! Zoe brought and read Arthur Miller's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/11/12/specials/miller-common.html" target="_blank">Tragedy and the Common Man</a>, and we discussed tragedy, both in the academic/ literary sense, and as a way of processing the current violence and tragedy that is happening globally. In particular, we discussed if/ how the literary definition of tragedy (an exalted figure who is brought down by a tragic flaw) can be reconciled with our more colloquial understanding of tragedy. Then, Shirlee gave a fantastic introduction to and explanation of CRISPR-cas9, a new gene editing technology which is taking the world by storm. This is a potentially revolutionally new technology that could have major implications for healthcare, ethics, and beyond. Researchers found that a certain bacterial gene locus which had a pattern of repeating segments (e.g., the CRISPRs) interspersed with other sequences of bases (say, "NNNN") could match with, and cut, that pattern "NNNN" in another gene. This bacteria brings in the cas9 proteins which are able to do the actual cutting. Then, the CRISPR sequence, with interspersed patterns provides a template for the gene to repair itself against. This is how a gene can be edited - both additively and subtractively! The CRISPR sequences and interspersed patterns are synthesized; the patterns are synthesized to match certain sequences in actual DNA. Shirlee gave a great presentation that made the information accessible on multiple levels! </p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #22 - 12/2/15</h3>
    <p>A rainy day and a cozy group. Zoe (champion of salon readings!) brought and read a Jack Gilbert poem called <a href="http://thesunmagazine.org/issues/451/a_brief_for_the_defense" target="_blank">A Brief for the Defense</a>, which discusses the appropriate response to seeing tragedy and horror in the world (an all-too-apt topic of conversation these days). The conversation touched on some of the same issues as last week; we discussed feelings of helplessness, guilt, and being overwhelmed. With the poem, we came to the conclusion that it is not productive to be consumed by guilt and sorrow; we must live our lives and experience joy while staying aware of tragedy and sorrow. After this discussion, Aviva gave an information-packed presentation on her giant fruit sticker collection (8000+ distinct fruit and veggie stickers!) and about how fruit labeling works and the international fruit shipping industry. She also gave us an in-depth explanation of hybrid breeding works in the case of the Pluot, and spoke about the two family farms that are the main pluot distributors. We also started an interesting discussion on GMO crops, which will hopefully be continued in the future!</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #23 - 1/13/16</h3>
    <p>Everyone seemed to agree that the first salon of the new year (2016!!) was an engaging success! Many thanks to Ariel and Aviva for their reading and presentation (respectively), both of which stoked long conversations that will hopefully be continued outside of salon! Ariel read excerpts from an excellent essay by cryptographer Phillip Rogaway called <a href="http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/moral-fn.pdf" target="_blank">The Moral Character of Cryptographic Work</a>. We discussed the morality and ethics of academic funding, the racial undercurrents of America's survelliance program, and the future of privacy. After this discussion, Aviva gave a fascinating and detailed presentation on the history and science of GMOs. We learned about different types of crop breeding (including the more traditional hybrid breeding and the newer genetic engineering techniques), the testing and regulatory process for GMO crops, and some of the controversies around GMO labeling and production.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #24 - 1/27/16</h3>
    <p>We kicked off this week's salon with some fun catch-up and a discussion of names (hyphenated last names, anybody?). Courtney brought in an opinion piece that argued that you shouldn't look for work "that you love", but that you should instead find a practical job that pays your bills, and spend your free time doing what you love. We discussed the merits of this idea, and whether or not we had grown up in an environment that prioritized profitability over fulfillment (or vice versa). We also discussed how the pressure to "do what you love" may be especially pronounced for our generation and among graduates of elite universities. Finally, we returned to the perennially difficult and interesting discussion of how to balance a career and family - child care? Living close to one's parents? A partner who believes in equal responsiblities? This conversation took us to nearly 10pm, so we decided to postpone the speaker presentation until next time!</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #25 - 2/10/16</h3>
    <p>This week, for the 25th(!) salon, we had special homemade green tea shortbread cookies (baked and decorated by Shirlee and Aviva - thank you!), and a new "tea bar". Fun updates! Miranda read a funny and pointed NYT Op-Ed titled <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/opinion/the-eight-second-attention-span.html?_r=0">The Eight-Second Attention Span</a>. The piece discussed how smartphones and media have weakened our ability to pay attention or think deeply. We spoke of meditative techniques and practices (like gardening or pottery), and also discussed how the phenomenon of short attention spans may contribute to the tumultuous and soundbyte-driven quality of the current presidential campaign. After this discussion (and a brief consideration of "should I support Hillary because I'm female?"), Chelsea engaged us in a challenging and interesting discussion about effective altruism. The challenges of effective altruism include figuring out how best to deploy funds to better humanity and measure/ quantify the impact of your donations. We discussed how it is difficult to fully understand the effects of international development efforts (e.g. malaria nets being used in overfishing), and also whether or not the potential of Artificial Intelligence represents a real/ true/ present threat to humanity that should be mitigated through fundraising and donations.</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #26 - 2/24/16</h3>
    <p>Another big, lively salon gathering! Shirlee commented afterwards that salon seems to have taken on new life in the past few months, with larger groups, and conversation that is both casual/ comfortable and lively. I agree with her (and hope you do too!) and thank you for participating in this journey!! The "tea bar" made another appearence this week, along with amazing pumpkin muffins from Katherine and some beautiful flowers from Joy. To kick off the evening, I (Caroline J) read Frederic Laloux's essay: <a href="http://www.strategy-business.com/article/00344?gko=10921" target="_blank">The Future of Management Is Teal</a>. I discovered Laloux by reading his book, Reinventing Organizations, in one of my classes. He discusses different paradigms for organizational management, assigning them color codes that map to different stages of human evolution and consciousness. We had a lively discussion about the relative merits of different management styles and structures, and related our experience with these different styles. Plans were developed to have a follow-up session on leadership/ management styles at the next salon. After this discussion, Zoe gave a fantastic presentation on the quirks and uncertainties of Elizabethan publishing practices, especially regarding Shakespeare's oeuvre and popular misconceptions about its consistency. We learned that the Elizabethan era held very different notions of ownership and authorship. Because anybody could transcribe a play and sell it to a publisher, and because the publishers often (inadvertently) inserted typos or inconsistencies into the quartos and folios they sold, there exist many versions of Shakespeare's plays. This understanding casts new light on the modern practice of close textual analysis; Zoe gave the example of how uncertainty about a single letter in a single word near the end of Othello could lead to radically different interpretations of the play.</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #27 - 3/9/16</h3>
    <p>With twelve people, and a mix of old and new faces, this may have been the biggest salon ever! Courtney shared a two-part, multimedia "reading" about leadership.  She read an HBR article called <a href="https://hbr.org/2008/01/love-and-fear-and-the-modern-boss" target="_blank">Love and Fear and the Modern Boss</a> and shared a portion of <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/sheryl_sandberg_why_we_have_too_few_women_leaders?language=en" target="_blank">Sheryl Sandberg's famous TED talk about why there are so few women leaders</a>. We discussed whether it is better to be loved or feared as a leader, and spoke about our own experiences in leadership positions, as well as our experiences judging other women in leadership positions. We also discussed, more generally, the bias that is inherent in selecting/ promoting leaders. One particularly salient point that came forward was the idea that, even though minorities are often self-conscious about the idea that "affirmative action" helped them reach their current position, people in positions of privilege rarely think about how their privilege allowed them to get to that point. After this discussion, Ani gave a fantastic and thorough presention on how context influences cognition, which in turn influences perception, which in turn mediates reality. She asked us to ponder questions like: "what technologies affect each of these processes, and how do you make art and technologies that both change our physiological perception and make us aware of the context of our perception?" She shared a slideshow of amazing examples of art and technology that attempt to change these perceptive processes, and then let us demo her own creation: a pair of face visors outfitted with cameras that allow you to swap vision with the person wearing the other visor. The experience was both playful and strange!</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #28 - 3/23/16</h3>
    <p>Another lovely evening with a lovely group of people! Since my birthday is on 3/25 (two days after salon), and I was on Spring Break, I decided to do a little baking for this salon. With the generous and savvy help of Shirlee and Aviva, I made two (!!) cakes, using recipes from Smitten Kitchen (the <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2008/10/pink-lady-cake/" target="blank">Pink Lady Cake</a> and the <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2016/01/blood-orange-almond-and-ricotta-cake/" target="_blank">Blood Orange, Almond & Ricotta Cake</a>). Mine didn't look quite as pretty, but the consensus was that they were pretty tasty! After taking a few minutes to settle in (read: scrambling to finish the cakes!), Zoe shared a beautiful and thought-provoking poem with us called <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/171611" target="_blank">The Search Party</a> by William Matthews. This was a tricky poem that we read several times; it forced us to question the truth of the poem's narrative and the reliability and intent of the narrator; it also led us to a discussion about the practice and purpose of art and self-reflection. Zoe once again delivered a splendid and insightful reading of the poem - thank you, as always! After this discussion, Snoweria gave a great presentation about a project she is working on for one of her studios at the GSD. As part of this studio, she and her partner are redesigning a waste facility in Stockholm to include an updated waste facility and a mosque (the studio is built around the idea of colocating waste facilities with other public uses). Snoweria walked us through the design of the new facility, and engaged with us in a great conversation about the potentially political nature of architecture and how the narrative of a building can influence its reception and usage. We were all quite impressed by her presentation's beautiful graphics and exciting narrative!</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #29 - 4/4/16</h3>
    <p>This salon was particularly special because we had our first discussion with a visiting "speaker". We were very lucky to welcome the inimitable Yvonne Hao, who works at Bain Capital with Jenny Xia, to our salon this week for a great discussion on life, family, and career. Many thanks to Jenny for suggesting that Yvonne come speak with us, making the connection, and coordinating logistics! We all very much enjoyed our wide-ranging discussion with Yvonne. We learned about her education and work background, her parenting philosophy, and how she and her husband balance their careers. We also discussed the importance of women supporting each other in the workplace, and strategies for doing so. It was very inspiring and reassuring to hear about Yvonne's experience; she has been incredibly successful and balances many responsiblities, but also acknowledged the often unpredictable and haphazard nature of one's life and career. Our talk with Yvonne generated a lot of debriefing and post-salon discussion - I think it will remain an inspiring and useful guide for our own lives. Many thanks to Yvonne for coming to speak with us!</p>
</div>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #30 - 4/20/16</h3>
    <p>This late April salon was lively and fun! To kick off the evening, we went around the circle introducing ourselves and describing an interesting conversation we had had recently. These introductions ended up taking on a life of their own, as we discussed topics as far-ranging as the 10,000 Year Clock, biogeneric drugs, the new Harriet Tubman bill, and various podcasts. Afterwards, Miranda read Joan Didion's beautiful essay <a href="https://yale.learningu.org/download/85e1ca3695ab0e000f2c8bf10be1a59d/S574_didion_respect.pdf" target="_blank">On Self Respect</a>. We discussed what self-respect means to us, and to Didion, and thought about how our senses of self-respect have changed at different points of our life. We wondered whether self-respect comes from your family's influence, or your education/ career, or the social norms that surround you. We discussed the relationship between self-respect, confidence, and extroversion. It was a lovely and thought-provoking evening to share!</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #31 - 5/4/16</h3>
    <p>Despite the dreary weather (45 degrees and raining in May?! Come on, Boston...), we had a nice evening gathering with a lovely group of women. Like the previous salon, we opened by introducing ourselves and describing an interesting article/ conversation/ discussion/ book we had encountered recently. It's amazing to hear about all the different conversations people are having and the ideas they are exposed to. Some of the ideas mentioned included a book called "Difficult Conversations", the absurdity of the Met Gala, a community art project that looks at desires at different stages of life, and the ridiculous state of the current political atmosphere (N.B. this was the day after Trump won Iowa and Cruz and Kasich dropped out of the Republican nominating contest). After these introductions, Zoe read Auden's haunting poem, <a href="http://www.poemdujour.com/Sept1.1939.html" target="_blank">September 1, 1939</a>, which was written near the beginning of WWII, and discusses the dread, anxiety, and horror of WWII. It has a beautiful line describing the 1930's as a "low dishonest decade"; we discussed the 1930's moniker as the "Age of Anxiety", and wondered about how we would characterize our current decade (some have called it the "Age of Alienation"). We discussed how we should/ could relate to the sense of dread or doom that surrounds us (especially in light of current political climate, environmental damage, refugee crisis), even if it's not affecting us directly. We ended on a bit of a lighter note by discussing movies from the early 2000's. There will be a bit of a salon hiatus due to my travel schedule, but we'll be back in early June! </p>

    <h3>Salon #32 - 6/1/16</h3>
    <p>For this salon, we hosted a modified version of Candy's <a href="http://friendslivingroomart.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Living Room Art Museum</a> idea. I asked everyone to bring a piece of art that they had made to share with the group. We had a great group with an interesting and diverse range of talents, hobbies, and projects including: glassblowing (Ariel), a handmade dinosaur costume (Jenny), cheerful summer sangria glasses (Laura), watermelon carving (Aviva), a knock-out open mic singing performance (Kate), animation (Sophie), hip-hop dancing (Erin), poetry (Zoe), and ceramics (me)! Thank you to everyone for coming and sharing - hope to do this one again sometime soon. Thank you also to my Mom and Zoe for providing delicious, GF sweets for the evening!</p>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon Outing - 6/22/16</h3>
    <p>Almost a year to the day after a similar outing last year, six of us attended one of the Boston Public Library's "Concerts in the Courtyard". This year, we heard <a href="http://eduardomercurimusic.com/" target="_blank">Eduardo Mercuri</a> (and his band), a group of Berklee students who played lovely Brazilian music. The courtyard was a beautiful, serene setting. Afterwards, we ate dinner at nearby Bar Lola and strolled up and down Newbury Street.</p>

    <h3>Salon #33 - 7/6/16</h3>
    <p>We took salon outside (to the porch) for this very warm evening. Sophie brought and discussed the book Creativity, Inc., which tells the story of Pixar's founding and coming of age. It was particularly interesting to hear about Steve Jobs' role in founding/ guiding the company, which was apparently quite different (e.g. more gentle and hands-off) than his role within Apple. We wondered about how a company's creativity and culture can scale with size. After this discussion, Ariel told us about the fascinating trip from which she had just returned: a trip to Italy with an MIT Civil Engineering professor to study ancient concrete, document ancient ruins, and prototype virtual reality (VR) interactive displays for exploring and documenting the ruins. Ariel also brought two relatively low-tech VR headsets (including one Google Cardboard headset) that are basically enclosures for a mobile phone running the Google Cardboard app. We took turns viewing photos from her trip and panoramas in the headsets (it was fun and weird!). We also had a fascinating discussion about VR, where we specifically discussed how VR is a luxury/ privilege in some settings (e.g. "renting bodies to do work") and a mark of non-privilege in others (e.g. visiting a destination through VR instead of actually being able to go there). This converation led to further discussion of our human/ physical essence (are we our thoughts and experiences or our physical bodies), evolution, disease, and the vast challenges of humanity. Lovely evening and great discussion!</p>

    <h3>Salon #34 - 7/19/16</h3>
    <p>At this salon, we had the pleasure of hearing Abla read from sister's book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dreams-Maryam-Tair-Blossoms-Interlink/dp/1566560918" target="_blank">Dreams of Maryam Tair: Blue Boots and Orange Blossoms</a>. Abla's sister, Mhani, was originally going to join us to read herself (she was visiting Boston this week), but wasn't able to come at the last minute. Abla stepped in and did a wonderful job reading, sharing several beautiful passages from this book, set in Casablanca, about a modern day Adam and Lilith, and their daughter Maryam. The book uses magical realism and has several strong female characters and feminist themes. We loved to book and are excited to read more on our own! After this beautiful reading, Aviva (our fountain of nutritional knowledge) gave us a quick presentation on different diet fads and different types of fats. We discussed how the peer review system and the way the media treats nutrition studies can sometimes lead to flawed or misleading results. The best nutritional advice that came out of the evening? Avoid saturated fats, but mostly, be moderate. As part of a balanced diet, a little bit of almost anything is okay :)</p>

    <h3>Salon Pool Party - 8/3/16</h3>
    <p>Courtney generously offered to host us at her apartment pool for a mid-summer salon pool party. We had a great time relaxing, snacking, and cooling off at her fantastic pool while chatting about politics, the Olympics, dating, and start-up ideas. Lovely evening!</p>

    <h3>Salon #35 - 8/17/16</h3>
    <p>Mid-August feels like peak summer, and in the summer, we just want to hang. At this small but lovely salon, we snacked, watched the Olympics (and discussed some of the major inspirations and controversies), and played backcountry Coup.</p>

    <h3>Salon #36 - 8/31/16</h3>
    <p>This late-summer salon was a great way to jumpstart some of the interesting discussions I hope we'll have throughout the fall! Ariel kicked things off by reading excerpts from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Packing-Mars-Curious-Science-Life/dp/1469235919" target="_blank">Packing for Mars</a>, a humorous yet thought-provoking book about life in space. We learned about some of the psychological and physical sacrifices that astronauts must make when they live in space and during their preparation for living in space. We also discussed whether we would want to become an astronaut (not very many of us) and whether we would be willing to abandon earth for another planet in case of earthly disaster (more of us). Afterwards, Kate led us through an extremely useful discussion of the <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Massachusetts_2016_ballot_measures" target="_blank">4 questions</a> that will be on the November 8 Massachusetts ballot and through some of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1js3TW8UvTds6WwSBH4c4qRxsbMNRxCvYtfSl6QFel0Q/edit#gid=0" target="_">decisions</a> that will be on the September 8 Massachusetts primary ballot. She gave us thorough information about each ballot question, and also about the groups who support different sides of each measure. This was an incredibly useful exercise that also led to interesting discussion. Thank you Ariel and Kate! Now go out and vote!!</p>

    <h3>Salon #37 - 9/15/16</h3>
    <p>After what was (at least for me) an exhausting first week of classes and academic responsiblities, it was really nice to get together with the salon group for an interesting and low-key evening. Also, this early September weather has been somewhat chilly, so it actually felt great to curl up with a cup of warm tea. We started by listening to a 99% Invisible podcast about "Unpleasant Design". The podcast discussed design choices that are meant to exclude or turn away certains groups (whether they are teens, homeless people, or pigeons), and the consequences of such design. We talked about places we see exclusive or unpleasant design in our own lives, and discussed whether we think it's a good or bad thing (it's easier to think it's "bad" when you don't have to deal with it everyday - perhaps we are all NIMBYs at heart...). After this discussion, Astrid gave a fascinating retelling of her experience aboard the Neil Armstrong (a WHOI ocean research vessel), where she had lived for the past 6 weeks conducting research on currents, climate change, and water conditions. It was awesome to hear not only about the research aspect, but also about life aboard a ship, and all the crazy scheduling and lingo that goes along with it! </p>

    <h3>Salon #38 - 10/5/16</h3>
    <p>October is here and it definitely feels like Autumn is upon us. We had a small but lovely salon group for a great reading from Joy and some useful discussion about the future of salon. Joy shared an amusing and interesting piece from the New Yorker called: <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/12/the-ayahuasca-boom-in-the-u-s" target="_blank">The Drug of Choice for the Age of Kale</a>. The piece describes and discusses the growing usage of ayahuasca (a "natural", plant-based drug from South America) in urban centers in the U.S. We talked about our views on drug usage, drug laws, and whether the use of ayahuasca as the latest yuppie drug is an (in)appropriate act of cultural appropriation. It was particularly interesting to think about how sheer will power could replace the effects of different drugs (e.g. getting yourself to be alert and productive without caffeine, or loosening yourself up without alcohol). We were split on whether we actually wanted to try ayahuasca or not. After this discussion, we brainstormed some ideas for future salons. We've gotten to the point where most people have already given a presentation, so we thought it would be nice to have a few other "activities" on deck. Ideas included: having more speakers, and coming up with prompts so that we can continue having interesting, "non-small-talk" conversations with each other. Stay tuned!</p>

    <h3>Salon #39 - 10/20/16</h3>
    <p>At this salon, our last before the upcoming 2016 election, we had an extended conversation about some of the lesser-explored topics and stories of the election. In particular, we tried to understand the psyche of Trump voters by reading <a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-reasons-trumps-rise-that-no-one-talks-about/" target="_blank">this Cracked piece</a> about how the urban vs. rural divide in the U.S. explains some of the enthusiasm for Trump's outspoken style. We discussed sexism towards Hilary Clinton, and how increasing media polarization has led to such a disjointed election. I don't think anybody changed their mind about who they're voting for (we are urban, college-educated women after all...), but it was good to try to stuggle and think deeply about some of the issues at play. Relatedly, and after the fact, some of us watched this <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/snl_s_black_jeopardy_sketch_was_the_most_astute_analysis_of_american_politics.html" target="_blank">SNL sketch on Black Jeopardy</a>, which makes the astute point that one of the issues being left out of these "sympathy pieces" on Trump voters is their not-so-subtle racism. Funny and on-point.</p>

    <h3>Salon #40 - 11/10/16</h3>
    <p>We had originally planned to have a speaker at this salon, but she unfortunately had to cancel at the last minute. We're working on rescheduling... Instead, a small group of us got together to discuss, debrief, commiserate, and plan in the wake of the election. Everyone has been feeling pretty lousy about the result, but it was nice to have a space to talk about our experiences and disappointments, discuss what we've been feeling, and come up with strategies to support vulnerable groups (and each other!). Onwards, and hopefully upwards. #ImWithHer</p>

    <h3>Salon #41 - 12/6/16</h3>
    <p>We were very lucky to host Professor Sara Bleich, of the Harvard School of Public Health, as our second salon speaker. Sara has had a very impressive tenure as a professor at both Johns Hopkins and Harvard, and as a White House Fellow. Many thanks to Aviva for making the connection with Sara and coordinating her visit! We enjoyed a wide-ranging discussion with Sara, covering Sara's background, upbringing, her thoughts on the future of public health, how she balances her family life and her work, her time at the White House, and her current research interests. It was a very fun and inspiring conversation - thank you Sara!</p>

    <h3>Salon #42 - 2/8/17</h3>
    <p>At this salon - the first of 2017 after a two month hiatus for the holidays and IAP travel - Miranda shared a great reading on Cathy O'Neil's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Math-Destruction-Increases-Inequality/dp/0553418815" target="_blank">Weapons of Math Destruction</a> (we did not actually have the book in hand, but read an essay with some of the same ideas). This book talks about how algorithms can be insidiously biased, and are built into our everyday experiences. O'Neil discusses how algorithms impact everything from credit scores to wellness assessments and policing tactics. That these algorithms are often "black-boxed" and treated as objective can be very detrimental to the people they impact, because algorithms can create self-reinforcing feedback loops that aren't necessarily fair to everyone. Miranda also shared a (rather alarming) article about Cambridge Analytica, a consulting group that collects information on the population's personality types (via a Facebook quiz), and sells that information to political campaigns, who in turn use it to deliver targeted political advertisements. We discussed how and why bias is injected into supposedly objective algorithms, and whether or not we would want to live in a world without the effects of big data and algorithms. <br><br>After this discussion, I shared a presentation on my 2-week experience in Hong Kong through MIT's <a href="http://memsi.mit.edu" target="_blank">MEMSI</a> program, an immersive experience that brought together students from MIT and Hong Kong to learn about hardware manufacturing and entrepreneurship. During the program, we went on a 2-day field trip to Shenzhen and Dongguan, where we visited 5 factories and learned about different production techniques. I shared photos and reflections from this trip, touching on several themes including: scale, vertical integration, automation vs. human labor, customization, and personal relationships. It was fun to share my experience with others, and to kick off Salon 2017 with a bang! I also wanted to note that I was presented with an amazing surprise present from salon guests that included a stylish terrarium, hand-designed coasters, and a very generous Whole Foods gift card. I was very touched by the gifts and the thought!</p>

    <h3>Salon #43 - 2/23/17</h3>
    <p>We enjoyed a small but cozy salon during one of our rare Thursday gatherings. I read Rebecca Solnit's funny yet scathing feminist essay, <a href="http://rebeccasolnit.net/essay/men-explain-things-to-me/" target="_blank">Men Explain Things to Me</a>. This essay has been widely credited with giving rise to the term "mansplaining". We discussed different experiences in our careers and personal lives that we felt exemplified the ideas in the essay, and we discussed strategies for combatting mansplaining and sexism. I appreciated how outspoken and forthright Solnit is - many other authors seem to tiptoe around the ideas in the essay, but she is very forward in her assertion that the issue discussed in her essay is related to gender. After this discussion, Aviva read the first chapter of David Koeppel's fascinating book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Banana-Fate-Fruit-Changed-World/dp/0452290082" target="_blank">Banana</a>, which discusses the history of the modern banana. We learned about the banana's role and cultivation throughout history, from the Garden of Eden (some scholars contend that Eve ate a banana instead of an apple) to its outsize role in the "Banana Republics" of the early 20th Century, to the current struggle of food scientists to evade Panama Disease. The banana is the most-consumed fruit in the USA, and the fourth-most cultivated crop globally. Complex supply chains that manage how bananas ripen have been developed to bring a predictable, robust product to consumers all over the globe. Turns out there is a lot of intrigue behind the humble banana!</p>
