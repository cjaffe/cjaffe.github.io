</div>

<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #14 - 6/3/15</h3>
    <p>Though a slightly haphazard setting with the couch and red chair gone, we had a lovely happy group. Zoe read a fantastic Hemingway fairytale/ parable about a fighting bull from a feminist storybook called "The Outspoken Princess and The Gentle Knight" (which I will definitely be reading to my future children). Then, Caroline J. read an essay called "Mission and Metrics" from her advisor, Sep Kamvar's, essay book. We discussed how bad metrics can sometimes be antithetical to the purpose and goals of different organizations, cited examples, and pondered how to fix the metrics problem. Next time we (may) break from the regular salon schedule for a summer picnic, and to tearfully say goodbye to all the people departing for new cities, and then we'll be back the following time with our regular programming.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon Outing - 6/17/15</h3>
    <p>Six of us ventured out of Cambridge to attend one of the Boston Public Library's "Concerts in the Courtyard". The band was <a href="http://www.chorobop.org/">ChoroBop</a>, a fantastic group of 3 Brazilian Berklee students who played a mix of choro and jazz. The courtyard was a beautiful, serene setting. Afterwards, we ate a lively dinner at nearby Casa Romero.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #15 - 7/1/15</h3>
    <p>Caroline N. read a piece about Vera Wang's various career incarnations; we spoke about career paths and the search for excellence in one's career.

<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon Outing/ Activity - 7/29/15</h3>

</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #16 - 8/10/15</h3>
    <p>Zoe shared two poems on loss, forgetfulness, and memory: One Art by Elizabeth Bishop and Forgetfulness by Billy Collins. We discussed the tight-knit relationship betwen these concepts. Does forgetting knowledge or facts constitute a loss? How does forgetfulness play into the processing and closure of an emotional loss? Joy then gave a presentation on the renewable energy industry - we learned about the different financing schemes and about her specific role as an analyst at Next Step Living.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #17 - 9/21/15</h3>
    <p>Zoe shared another beautiful and thought-provoking art experience with us. She showed Bruegel's Landscape with the Fall of Icarus, and read two poems that meditate on the painting: Landscape with the Fall of Icarus by William Carlos Williams and Musee des Beaux Arts by WH Auden. We discussed how we process others' suffering, and how it is hard for people outside our fields to process the striving/ falling experienced in a very narrow, deep and specific discipline. Kim led us through a fun, challenging and enlightening drawing experience where we did blind contour drawings with partners. We learned a bit about her artistic process and her experience as a scientific illustrator. Ani also shared some of her project ideas from How To Make (Almost) Anything! Great way to get back into Salon after a bit of a break...looking forward to the fall!</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #18 - 10/7/15</h3>
    <p>Zoe read a <a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/09/11/the-most-misread-poem-in-america/" target="_blank">hilarious and insightful essay</a> from the Paris Review about Robert Frost's often misinterpreted poem, "The Road Not Taken". The piece deconstructs the outsize popularity of the poem, as well as its meaning. Here is a representative quote: <br><br>"Most readers consider “The Road Not Taken” to be a paean to triumphant self-assertion (“I took the one less traveled by”), but the literal meaning of the poem’s own lines seems completely at odds with this interpretation. The poem’s speaker tells us he “shall be telling,” at some point in the future, of how he took the road less traveled by, yet he has already admitted that the two paths “equally lay / In leaves” and “the passing there / Had worn them really about the same.” So the road he will later call less traveled is actually the road equally traveled. The two roads are interchangeable.

According to this reading, then, the speaker will be claiming “ages and ages hence” that his decision made “all the difference” only because this is the kind of claim we make when we want to comfort or blame ourselves by assuming that our current position is the product of our own choices (as opposed to what was chosen for us or allotted to us by chance). The poem isn’t a salute to can-do individualism; it’s a commentary on the self-deception we practice when constructing the story of our own lives."<br><br>
Ariel then gave a fantastic presentation on Bitcoin and Blockchain technology. We learned about transaction validation protocol, the public ledger, Bitcoin mining, other uses for Blockchain technology, and more. It was the most coherent and interesting explanation of Bitcoin I've ever heard - thank you Ariel!</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #19 - 10/21/15</h3>
    <p>Caroline shared some readings about the conflict between construction and preservation in New York City. Even though old buildings and beautiful and charming, they tend to be low-rise buildings that accomodate fewer people than buildings built using modern building technologies. One idea is that favoring construction over preservation would allow cities to become more affordable and inclusive. On the other hand, some super-tall but super-expensive apartment buildings are being built using tricks like FAR trading. Some developers are able to fulfill their requirement to build low-income housing in crafty ways that are not necessarily true to the spirit of inclusive neighborhood policy. We also discussed how a city should decide what to save and what deserves to be preserved. Courtney then gave a great presentation about her experience as a chess champion! We learned about tournament play and discussed the treatment/ experience of women in the chess world. We learned about why Courtney started (and stopped) playing, and how she occasionally brings out her skills nowadays to keep people on their toes! She also brought a few fun chess puzzles that we practiced solving.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #20 - 11/5/15</h3>
    <p>A great, jovial salon group! Jenny read a funny and thought-provoking Gloria Steinem piece called <a href="http://ww3.haverford.edu/psychology/ddavis/p109g/steinem.menstruate.html" target="_blank">If Men Could Menstrate</a>, which discussed the gendered power justifications surrounding menstration (or lack thereof). We also discussed periods more generally, and the way menstruation is dealt with in relationships and professional settings. Katherine then gave a fascinating presentation on the chemical composition of different body washes, cleansers and shampoos. We learned about the different surfactants (i.e. the compounds that actually clean you) in different mixtures, as well as the compounds that affect the texture or viscosity of a fluid. We also learned about how lather, and how bars of soap, because they generally have such a high pH, can dry out your skin even though they generate a really creamy lather. Katherine worked for Dove (at Unilever) and told us about the chemistry that differentiates Dove products. In particular, she developed a Dove body wash with a high concentration of petroleum that is very mosturizing. Finally, we got to test a bunch of different cleansers - putting our new knowledge to use!</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #21 - 11/18/15</h3>
    <p>Another great, big group! Zoe brought and read Arthur Miller's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/11/12/specials/miller-common.html" target="_blank">Tragedy and the Common Man</a>, and we discussed tragedy, both in the academic/ literary sense, and as a way of processing the current violence and tragedy that is happening globally. In particular, we discussed if/ how the literary definition of tragedy (an exalted figure who is brought down by a tragic flaw) can be reconciled with our more colloquial understanding of tragedy. Then, Shirlee gave a fantastic introduction to and explanation of CRISPR-cas9, a new gene editing technology which is taking the world by storm. This is a potentially revolutionally new technology that could have major implications for healthcare, ethics, and beyond. Researchers found that a certain bacterial gene locus which had a pattern of repeating segments (e.g., the CRISPRs) interspersed with other sequences of bases (say, "NNNN") could match with, and cut, that pattern "NNNN" in another gene. This bacteria brings in the cas9 proteins which are able to do the actual cutting. Then, the CRISPR sequence, with interspersed patterns provides a template for the gene to repair itself against. This is how a gene can be edited - both additively and subtractively! The CRISPR sequences and interspersed patterns are synthesized; the patterns are synthesized to match certain sequences in actual DNA. Shirlee gave a great presentation that made the information accessible on multiple levels! </p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #22 - 12/2/15</h3>
    <p>A rainy day and a cozy group. Zoe (champion of salon readings!) brought and read a Jack Gilbert poem called <a href="http://thesunmagazine.org/issues/451/a_brief_for_the_defense" target="_blank">A Brief for the Defense</a>, which discusses the appropriate response to seeing tragedy and horror in the world (an all-too-apt topic of conversation these days). The conversation touched on some of the same issues as last week; we discussed feelings of helplessness, guilt, and being overwhelmed. With the poem, we came to the conclusion that it is not productive to be consumed by guilt and sorrow; we must live our lives and experience joy while staying aware of tragedy and sorrow. After this discussion, Aviva gave an information-packed presentation on her giant fruit sticker collection (8000+ distinct fruit and veggie stickers!) and about how fruit labeling works and the international fruit shipping industry. She also gave us an in-depth explanation of hybrid breeding works in the case of the Pluot, and spoke about the two family farms that are the main pluot distributors. We also started an interesting discussion on GMO crops, which will hopefully be continued in the future!</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #23 - 1/13/16</h3>
    <p>Everyone seemed to agree that the first salon of the new year (2016!!) was an engaging success! Many thanks to Ariel and Aviva for their reading and presentation (respectively), both of which stoked long conversations that will hopefully be continued outside of salon! Ariel read excerpts from an excellent essay by cryptographer Phillip Rogaway called <a href="http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/moral-fn.pdf" target="_blank">The Moral Character of Cryptographic Work</a>. We discussed the morality and ethics of academic funding, the racial undercurrents of America's survelliance program, and the future of privacy. After this discussion, Aviva gave a fascinating and detailed presentation on the history and science of GMOs. We learned about different types of crop breeding (including the more traditional hybrid breeding and the newer genetic engineering techniques), the testing and regulatory process for GMO crops, and some of the controversies around GMO labeling and production.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #24 - 1/27/16</h3>
    <p>We kicked off this week's salon with some fun catch-up and a discussion of names (hyphenated last names, anybody?). Courtney brought in an opinion piece that argued that you shouldn't look for work "that you love", but that you should instead find a practical job that pays your bills, and spend your free time doing what you love. We discussed the merits of this idea, and whether or not we had grown up in an environment that prioritized profitability over fulfillment (or vice versa). We also discussed how the pressure to "do what you love" may be especially pronounced for our generation and among graduates of elite universities. Finally, we returned to the perennially difficult and interesting discussion of how to balance a career and family - child care? Living close to one's parents? A partner who believes in equal responsiblities? This conversation took us to nearly 10pm, so we decided to postpone the speaker presentation until next time!</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #25 - 2/10/16</h3>
    <p>This week, for the 25th(!) salon, we had special homemade green tea shortbread cookies (baked and decorated by Shirlee and Aviva - thank you!), and a new "tea bar". Fun updates! Miranda read a funny and pointed NYT Op-Ed titled <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/opinion/the-eight-second-attention-span.html?_r=0">The Eight-Second Attention Span</a>. The piece discussed how smartphones and media have weakened our ability to pay attention or think deeply. We spoke of meditative techniques and practices (like gardening or pottery), and also discussed how the phenomenon of short attention spans may contribute to the tumultuous and soundbyte-driven quality of the current presidential campaign. After this discussion (and a brief consideration of "should I support Hillary because I'm female?"), Chelsea engaged us in a challenging and interesting discussion about effective altruism. The challenges of effective altruism include figuring out how best to deploy funds to better humanity and measure/ quantify the impact of your donations. We discussed how it is difficult to fully understand the effects of international development efforts (e.g. malaria nets being used in overfishing), and also whether or not the potential of Artificial Intelligence represents a real/ true/ present threat to humanity that should be mitigated through fundraising and donations.</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #26 - 2/24/16</h3>
    <p>Another big, lively salon gathering! Shirlee commented afterwards that salon seems to have taken on new life in the past few months, with larger groups, and conversation that is both casual/ comfortable and lively. I agree with her (and hope you do too!) and thank you for participating in this journey!! The "tea bar" made another appearence this week, along with amazing pumpkin muffins from Katherine and some beautiful flowers from Joy. To kick off the evening, I (Caroline J) read Frederic Laloux's essay: <a href="http://www.strategy-business.com/article/00344?gko=10921" target="_blank">The Future of Management Is Teal</a>. I discovered Laloux by reading his book, Reinventing Organizations, in one of my classes. He discusses different paradigms for organizational management, assigning them color codes that map to different stages of human evolution and consciousness. We had a lively discussion about the relative merits of different management styles and structures, and related our experience with these different styles. Plans were developed to have a follow-up session on leadership/ management styles at the next salon. After this discussion, Zoe gave a fantastic presentation on the quirks and uncertainties of Elizabethan publishing practices, especially regarding Shakespeare's oeuvre and popular misconceptions about its consistency. We learned that the Elizabethan era held very different notions of ownership and authorship. Because anybody could transcribe a play and sell it to a publisher, and because the publishers often (inadvertently) inserted typos or inconsistencies into the quartos and folios they sold, there exist many versions of Shakespeare's plays. This understanding casts new light on the modern practice of close textual analysis; Zoe gave the example of how uncertainty about a single letter in a single word near the end of Othello could lead to radically different interpretations of the play.</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #27 - 3/9/16</h3>
    <p>With twelve people, and a mix of old and new faces, this may have been the biggest salon ever! Courtney shared a two-part, multimedia "reading" about leadership.  She read an HBR article called <a href="https://hbr.org/2008/01/love-and-fear-and-the-modern-boss" target="_blank">Love and Fear and the Modern Boss</a> and shared a portion of <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/sheryl_sandberg_why_we_have_too_few_women_leaders?language=en" target="_blank">Sheryl Sandberg's famous TED talk about why there are so few women leaders</a>. We discussed whether it is better to be loved or feared as a leader, and spoke about our own experiences in leadership positions, as well as our experiences judging other women in leadership positions. We also discussed, more generally, the bias that is inherent in selecting/ promoting leaders. One particularly salient point that came forward was the idea that, even though minorities are often self-conscious about the idea that "affirmative action" helped them reach their current position, people in positions of privilege rarely think about how their privilege allowed them to get to that point. After this discussion, Ani gave a fantastic and thorough presention on how context influences cognition, which in turn influences perception, which in turn mediates reality. She asked us to ponder questions like: "what technologies affect each of these processes, and how do you make art and technologies that both change our physiological perception and make us aware of the context of our perception?" She shared a slideshow of amazing examples of art and technology that attempt to change these perceptive processes, and then let us demo her own creation: a pair of face visors outfitted with cameras that allow you to swap vision with the person wearing the other visor. The experience was both playful and strange!</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #28 - 3/23/16</h3>
    <p>Another lovely evening with a lovely group of people! Since my birthday is on 3/25 (two days after salon), and I was on Spring Break, I decided to do a little baking for this salon. With the generous and savvy help of Shirlee and Aviva, I made two (!!) cakes, using recipes from Smitten Kitchen (the <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2008/10/pink-lady-cake/" target="blank">Pink Lady Cake</a> and the <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2016/01/blood-orange-almond-and-ricotta-cake/" target="_blank">Blood Orange, Almond & Ricotta Cake</a>). Mine didn't look quite as pretty, but the consensus was that they were pretty tasty! After taking a few minutes to settle in (read: scrambling to finish the cakes!), Zoe shared a beautiful and thought-provoking poem with us called <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/171611" target="_blank">The Search Party</a> by William Matthews. This was a tricky poem that we read several times; it forced us to question the truth of the poem's narrative and the reliability and intent of the narrator; it also led us to a discussion about the practice and purpose of art and self-reflection. Zoe once again delivered a splendid and insightful reading of the poem - thank you, as always! After this discussion, Snoweria gave a great presentation about a project she is working on for one of her studios at the GSD. As part of this studio, she and her partner are redesigning a waste facility in Stockholm to include an updated waste facility and a mosque (the studio is built around the idea of colocating waste facilities with other public uses). Snoweria walked us through the design of the new facility, and engaged with us in a great conversation about the potentially political nature of architecture and how the narrative of a building can influence its reception and usage. We were all quite impressed by her presentation's beautiful graphics and exciting narrative!</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #29 - 4/4/16</h3>
    <p>This salon was particularly special because we had our first discussion with a visiting "speaker". We were very lucky to welcome the inimitable Yvonne Hao, who works at Bain Capital with Jenny Xia, to our salon this week for a great discussion on life, family, and career. Many thanks to Jenny for suggesting that Yvonne come speak with us, making the connection, and coordinating logistics! We all very much enjoyed our wide-ranging discussion with Yvonne. We learned about her education and work background, her parenting philosophy, and how she and her husband balance their careers. We also discussed the importance of women supporting each other in the workplace, and strategies for doing so. It was very inspiring and reassuring to hear about Yvonne's experience; she has been incredibly successful and balances many responsiblities, but also acknowledged the often unpredictable and haphazard nature of one's life and career. Our talk with Yvonne generated a lot of debriefing and post-salon discussion - I think it will remain an inspiring and useful guide for our own lives. Many thanks to Yvonne for coming to speak with us!</p>
</div>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #30 - 4/20/16</h3>
    <p>This late April salon was lively and fun! To kick off the evening, we went around the circle introducing ourselves and describing an interesting conversation we had had recently. These introductions ended up taking on a life of their own, as we discussed topics as far-ranging as the 10,000 Year Clock, biogeneric drugs, the new Harriet Tubman bill, and various podcasts. Afterwards, Miranda read Joan Didion's beautiful essay <a href="https://yale.learningu.org/download/85e1ca3695ab0e000f2c8bf10be1a59d/S574_didion_respect.pdf" target="_blank">On Self Respect</a>. We discussed what self-respect means to us, and to Didion, and thought about how our senses of self-respect have changed at different points of our life. We wondered whether self-respect comes from your family's influence, or your education/ career, or the social norms that surround you. We discussed the relationship between self-respect, confidence, and extroversion. It was a lovely and thought-provoking evening to share!</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #31 - 5/4/16</h3>
    <p>Despite the dreary weather (45 degrees and raining in May?! Come on, Boston...), we had a nice evening gathering with a lovely group of women. Like the previous salon, we opened by introducing ourselves and describing an interesting article/ conversation/ discussion/ book we had encountered recently. It's amazing to hear about all the different conversations people are having and the ideas they are exposed to. Some of the ideas mentioned included a book called "Difficult Conversations", the absurdity of the Met Gala, a community art project that looks at desires at different stages of life, and the ridiculous state of the current political atmosphere (N.B. this was the day after Trump won Iowa and Cruz and Kasich dropped out of the Republican nominating contest). After these introductions, Zoe read Auden's haunting poem, <a href="http://www.poemdujour.com/Sept1.1939.html" target="_blank">September 1, 1939</a>, which was written near the beginning of WWII, and discusses the dread, anxiety, and horror of WWII. It has a beautiful line describing the 1930's as a "low dishonest decade"; we discussed the 1930's moniker as the "Age of Anxiety", and wondered about how we would characterize our current decade (some have called it the "Age of Alienation"). We discussed how we should/ could relate to the sense of dread or doom that surrounds us (especially in light of current political climate, environmental damage, refugee crisis), even if it's not affecting us directly. We ended on a bit of a lighter note by discussing movies from the early 2000's. There will be a bit of a salon hiatus due to my travel schedule, but we'll be back in early June! </p>

    <h3>Salon #32 - 6/1/16</h3>
    <p>For this salon, we hosted a modified version of Candy's <a href="http://friendslivingroomart.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Living Room Art Museum</a> idea. I asked everyone to bring a piece of art that they had made to share with the group. We had a great group with an interesting and diverse range of talents, hobbies, and projects including: glassblowing (Ariel), a handmade dinosaur costume (Jenny), cheerful summer sangria glasses (Laura), watermelon carving (Aviva), a knock-out open mic singing performance (Kate), animation (Sophie), hip-hop dancing (Erin), poetry (Zoe), and ceramics (me)! Thank you to everyone for coming and sharing - hope to do this one again sometime soon. Thank you also to my Mom and Zoe for providing delicious, GF sweets for the evening!</p>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon Outing - 6/22/16</h3>
    <p>Almost a year to the day after a similar outing last year, six of us attended one of the Boston Public Library's "Concerts in the Courtyard". This year, we heard <a href="http://eduardomercurimusic.com/" target="_blank">Eduardo Mercuri</a> (and his band), a group of Berklee students who played lovely Brazilian music. The courtyard was a beautiful, serene setting. Afterwards, we ate dinner at nearby Bar Lola and strolled up and down Newbury Street.</p>

    <h3>Salon #33 - 7/6/16</h3>
    <p>We took salon outside (to the porch) for this very warm evening. Sophie brought and discussed the book Creativity, Inc., which tells the story of Pixar's founding and coming of age. It was particularly interesting to hear about Steve Jobs' role in founding/ guiding the company, which was apparently quite different (e.g. more gentle and hands-off) than his role within Apple. We wondered about how a company's creativity and culture can scale with size. After this discussion, Ariel told us about the fascinating trip from which she had just returned: a trip to Italy with an MIT Civil Engineering professor to study ancient concrete, document ancient ruins, and prototype virtual reality (VR) interactive displays for exploring and documenting the ruins. Ariel also brought two relatively low-tech VR headsets (including one Google Cardboard headset) that are basically enclosures for a mobile phone running the Google Cardboard app. We took turns viewing photos from her trip and panoramas in the headsets (it was fun and weird!). We also had a fascinating discussion about VR, where we specifically discussed how VR is a luxury/ privilege in some settings (e.g. "renting bodies to do work") and a mark of non-privilege in others (e.g. visiting a destination through VR instead of actually being able to go there). This converation led to further discussion of our human/ physical essence (are we our thoughts and experiences or our physical bodies), evolution, disease, and the vast challenges of humanity. Lovely evening and great discussion!</p>

    <h3>Salon #34 - 7/19/16</h3>
    <p>At this salon, we had the pleasure of hearing Abla read from sister's book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dreams-Maryam-Tair-Blossoms-Interlink/dp/1566560918" target="_blank">Dreams of Maryam Tair: Blue Boots and Orange Blossoms</a>. Abla's sister, Mhani, was originally going to join us to read herself (she was visiting Boston this week), but wasn't able to come at the last minute. Abla stepped in and did a wonderful job reading, sharing several beautiful passages from this book, set in Casablanca, about a modern day Adam and Lilith, and their daughter Maryam. The book uses magical realism and has several strong female characters and feminist themes. We loved to book and are excited to read more on our own! After this beautiful reading, Aviva (our fountain of nutritional knowledge) gave us a quick presentation on different diet fads and different types of fats. We discussed how the peer review system and the way the media treats nutrition studies can sometimes lead to flawed or misleading results. The best nutritional advice that came out of the evening? Avoid saturated fats, but mostly, be moderate. As part of a balanced diet, a little bit of almost anything is okay :)</p>

    <h3>Salon Pool Party - 8/3/16</h3>
    <p>Courtney generously offered to host us at her apartment pool for a mid-summer salon pool party. We had a great time relaxing, snacking, and cooling off at her fantastic pool while chatting about politics, the Olympics, dating, and start-up ideas. Lovely evening!</p>

    <h3>Salon #35 - 8/17/16</h3>
    <p>Mid-August feels like peak summer, and in the summer, we just want to hang. At this small but lovely salon, we snacked, watched the Olympics (and discussed some of the major inspirations and controversies), and played backcountry Coup.</p>

    <h3>Salon #36 - 8/31/16</h3>
    <p>This late-summer salon was a great way to jumpstart some of the interesting discussions I hope we'll have throughout the fall! Ariel kicked things off by reading excerpts from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Packing-Mars-Curious-Science-Life/dp/1469235919" target="_blank">Packing for Mars</a>, a humorous yet thought-provoking book about life in space. We learned about some of the psychological and physical sacrifices that astronauts must make when they live in space and during their preparation for living in space. We also discussed whether we would want to become an astronaut (not very many of us) and whether we would be willing to abandon earth for another planet in case of earthly disaster (more of us). Afterwards, Kate led us through an extremely useful discussion of the <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Massachusetts_2016_ballot_measures" target="_blank">4 questions</a> that will be on the November 8 Massachusetts ballot and through some of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1js3TW8UvTds6WwSBH4c4qRxsbMNRxCvYtfSl6QFel0Q/edit#gid=0" target="_">decisions</a> that will be on the September 8 Massachusetts primary ballot. She gave us thorough information about each ballot question, and also about the groups who support different sides of each measure. This was an incredibly useful exercise that also led to interesting discussion. Thank you Ariel and Kate! Now go out and vote!!</p>

    <h3>Salon #37 - 9/15/16</h3>
    <p>After what was (at least for me) an exhausting first week of classes and academic responsiblities, it was really nice to get together with the salon group for an interesting and low-key evening. Also, this early September weather has been somewhat chilly, so it actually felt great to curl up with a cup of warm tea. We started by listening to a 99% Invisible podcast about "Unpleasant Design". The podcast discussed design choices that are meant to exclude or turn away certains groups (whether they are teens, homeless people, or pigeons), and the consequences of such design. We talked about places we see exclusive or unpleasant design in our own lives, and discussed whether we think it's a good or bad thing (it's easier to think it's "bad" when you don't have to deal with it everyday - perhaps we are all NIMBYs at heart...). After this discussion, Astrid gave a fascinating retelling of her experience aboard the Neil Armstrong (a WHOI ocean research vessel), where she had lived for the past 6 weeks conducting research on currents, climate change, and water conditions. It was awesome to hear not only about the research aspect, but also about life aboard a ship, and all the crazy scheduling and lingo that goes along with it! </p>

    <h3>Salon #38 - 10/5/16</h3>
    <p>October is here and it definitely feels like Autumn is upon us. We had a small but lovely salon group for a great reading from Joy and some useful discussion about the future of salon. Joy shared an amusing and interesting piece from the New Yorker called: <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/12/the-ayahuasca-boom-in-the-u-s" target="_blank">The Drug of Choice for the Age of Kale</a>. The piece describes and discusses the growing usage of ayahuasca (a "natural", plant-based drug from South America) in urban centers in the U.S. We talked about our views on drug usage, drug laws, and whether the use of ayahuasca as the latest yuppie drug is an (in)appropriate act of cultural appropriation. It was particularly interesting to think about how sheer will power could replace the effects of different drugs (e.g. getting yourself to be alert and productive without caffeine, or loosening yourself up without alcohol). We were split on whether we actually wanted to try ayahuasca or not. After this discussion, we brainstormed some ideas for future salons. We've gotten to the point where most people have already given a presentation, so we thought it would be nice to have a few other "activities" on deck. Ideas included: having more speakers, and coming up with prompts so that we can continue having interesting, "non-small-talk" conversations with each other. Stay tuned!</p>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #39 - 10/20/16</h3>
    <p>At this salon, our last before the upcoming 2016 election, we had an extended conversation about some of the lesser-explored topics and stories of the election. In particular, we tried to understand the psyche of Trump voters by reading <a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-reasons-trumps-rise-that-no-one-talks-about/" target="_blank">this Cracked piece</a> about how the urban vs. rural divide in the U.S. explains some of the enthusiasm for Trump's outspoken style. We discussed sexism towards Hilary Clinton, and how increasing media polarization has led to such a disjointed election. I don't think anybody changed their mind about who they're voting for (we are urban, college-educated women after all...), but it was good to try to stuggle and think deeply about some of the issues at play. Relatedly, and after the fact, some of us watched this <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/snl_s_black_jeopardy_sketch_was_the_most_astute_analysis_of_american_politics.html" target="_blank">SNL sketch on Black Jeopardy</a>, which makes the astute point that one of the issues being left out of these "sympathy pieces" on Trump voters is their not-so-subtle racism. Funny and on-point.</p>

    <h3>Salon #40 - 11/10/16</h3>
    <p>We had originally planned to have a speaker at this salon, but she unfortunately had to cancel at the last minute. We're working on rescheduling... Instead, a small group of us got together to discuss, debrief, commiserate, and plan in the wake of the election. Everyone has been feeling pretty lousy about the result, but it was nice to have a space to talk about our experiences and disappointments, discuss what we've been feeling, and come up with strategies to support vulnerable groups (and each other!). Onwards, and hopefully upwards. #ImWithHer</p>

    <h3>Salon #41 - 12/6/16</h3>
    <p>We were very lucky to host Professor Sara Bleich, of the Harvard School of Public Health, as our second salon speaker. Sara has had a very impressive tenure as a professor at both Johns Hopkins and Harvard, and as a White House Fellow. Many thanks to Aviva for making the connection with Sara and coordinating her visit! We enjoyed a wide-ranging discussion with Sara, covering Sara's background, upbringing, her thoughts on the future of public health, how she balances her family life and her work, her time at the White House, and her current research interests. It was a very fun and inspiring conversation - thank you Sara!</p>

    <h3>Salon #42 - 2/8/17</h3>
    <p>At this salon - the first of 2017 after a two month hiatus for the holidays and IAP travel - Miranda shared a great reading on Cathy O'Neil's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Math-Destruction-Increases-Inequality/dp/0553418815" target="_blank">Weapons of Math Destruction</a> (we did not actually have the book in hand, but read an essay with some of the same ideas). This book talks about how algorithms can be insidiously biased, and are built into our everyday experiences. O'Neil discusses how algorithms impact everything from credit scores to wellness assessments and policing tactics. That these algorithms are often "black-boxed" and treated as objective can be very detrimental to the people they impact, because algorithms can create self-reinforcing feedback loops that aren't necessarily fair to everyone. Miranda also shared a (rather alarming) article about Cambridge Analytica, a consulting group that collects information on the population's personality types (via a Facebook quiz), and sells that information to political campaigns, who in turn use it to deliver targeted political advertisements. We discussed how and why bias is injected into supposedly objective algorithms, and whether or not we would want to live in a world without the effects of big data and algorithms. <br><br>After this discussion, I shared a presentation on my 2-week experience in Hong Kong through MIT's <a href="http://memsi.mit.edu" target="_blank">MEMSI</a> program, an immersive experience that brought together students from MIT and Hong Kong to learn about hardware manufacturing and entrepreneurship. During the program, we went on a 2-day field trip to Shenzhen and Dongguan, where we visited 5 factories and learned about different production techniques. I shared photos and reflections from this trip, touching on several themes including: scale, vertical integration, automation vs. human labor, customization, and personal relationships. It was fun to share my experience with others, and to kick off Salon 2017 with a bang! I also wanted to note that I was presented with an amazing surprise present from salon guests that included a stylish terrarium, hand-designed coasters, and a very generous Whole Foods gift card. I was very touched by the gifts and the thought!</p>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #43 - 2/23/17</h3>
    <p>We enjoyed a small but cozy salon during one of our rare Thursday gatherings. I read Rebecca Solnit's funny yet scathing feminist essay, <a href="http://rebeccasolnit.net/essay/men-explain-things-to-me/" target="_blank">Men Explain Things to Me</a>. This essay has been widely credited with giving rise to the term "mansplaining". We discussed different experiences in our careers and personal lives that we felt exemplified the ideas in the essay, and we discussed strategies for combatting mansplaining and sexism. I appreciated how outspoken and forthright Solnit is - many other authors seem to tiptoe around the ideas in the essay, but she is very forward in her assertion that the issue discussed in her essay is related to gender. After this discussion, Aviva read the first chapter of David Koeppel's fascinating book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Banana-Fate-Fruit-Changed-World/dp/0452290082" target="_blank">Banana</a>, which discusses the history of the modern banana. We learned about the banana's role and cultivation throughout history, from the Garden of Eden (some scholars contend that Eve ate a banana instead of an apple) to its outsize role in the "Banana Republics" of the early 20th Century, to the current struggle of food scientists to evade Panama Disease. The banana is the most-consumed fruit in the USA, and the fourth-most cultivated crop globally. Complex supply chains that manage how bananas ripen have been developed to bring a predictable, robust product to consumers all over the globe. Turns out there is a lot of intrigue behind the humble banana!</p>

    <h3>Salon Outing - 3/9/17</h3>
    <p>In lieu of a discussion-based salon this week, several of us went to see <a href="http://www.jacksonthefilm.com/the-film/" target="_blank">Jackson</a>, which was screened, for free, as part of the <a href="http://wgs.mit.edu/women-take-the-reel/" target="_blank">Women Take the Reel film festival</a> in Boston. The film festival screens films by female directors at universities around Boston during the month of March. The film was incredibly moving - it followed the experience of the last remaining abortion clinic in Mississippi and the barage of regulation meant to close the clinic. I've written more reflections on the film in <a href="blog/blog4.html" target="_blank">this blog post</a>. The director, Maisie Crow, attended the screening and did a great job of answering questions afterwards. I highly recommend seeing this film!</p>

    <h3>Salon #44 - 3/22/17</h3>
    <p>To kick off the evening, Kat read us a beautiful Mary Oliver poem called <a href="http://www.best-poems.net/mary_oliver/starlings_in_winter.html" target="_blank">Starlings in Winter</a>. We talked about the language and imagery in the poem, and how it was especially appropriate for the "proto-spring" weather we're experiencing right now...we feel like we're on the cusp of something new and can't wait for it to happen! After discussing the poem, Snoweria (very graciously!) shared her architecture thesis and thesis presentation with us (she just received her M.Arch from the Harvard GSD). Her thesis concerned a redesign of the U.S. Supreme Court, which played upon issues of insanity and sanity, the current state of the highest court, and some of the interesting design choices of the current Supreme Court building (including the fact that there's a basketball court directly above the court chamber). Her presentation was elegant, intellectual, engaging, and amusing! Thank you, Snoweria, for showing us a window into your architectly ways! </p>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #45 - 4/13/17</h3>
    <p>We had a lovely salon this week with two fascinating readings. Erin read first, sharing a New Yorker piece called <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/the-trauma-of-facing-deportation" target="_blank">The Trauma of Facing Deportation</a>. The essay chronicles a mysterious disease that has surfaced in the past 10 years wherein refugee children living in Sweden, upon learning that their families may be deported, fall unconscious and become non-responsive -- sometimes for years. The story was heartbreaking and baffling, as most of us had never heard of this disease before, and it was so geographically specific and seemingly physically improbable that it was hard for us to conceptualize. Erin introduced us to the idea of culture-bound diseases (diseases or conditions that are linked to particular cultures), which provided a nice framing for the discussion. We also discussed immigration more generally, and current challenges and issues surrounding it. Afterwards, Snoweria shared a funny (and spot-on) <a href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950730&slug=2133972" target="_blank">humor column</a> about how men are prone to delivering unsolicited advice. The essay was somewhat reminiscent of Rebecca Solnit's essay (from 2/23/17), but was actually written by a reasonably self-aware man, and is from over 20 years ago! I guess somethings never change... We shared our experiences with unsolicited advice, and discussed strategies for combatting and understanding it.</p>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #46 - 4/26/17</h3>
    <p>To begin this salon, Ariel read us excerpts from an essay from a book of the best science and nature writing of 2015. The essay, which can also be found on the <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/tracking-ivory/article.html" target="_blank">National Geographic</a> website, discusses a scheme to map the illegal ivory trade in Africa by creating replica elephant tusks that contained GPS trackers. We had fun discussing some of the technical, ethical, and practical considerations of this project, as well as alternative methods (e.g. social or behavioral) to reduce the appeal and profitability of the illegal ivory trade. After Ariel's reading, Joy taught us about the U.S. National Parks system and discussed her experience exploring the parks. We talked about the parks' creation in the early 20th century, our favorite parks, and even schemed about some future trips. Joy's talk definitely made us all want to get outdoors and explore!</p>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #47 - 5/18/17</h3>
    <p>Caroline read a New York Times wellness essay called <a href="https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/19/writing-your-way-to-happiness/" target="_blank">Writing Your Way to Happiness</a>. The essay discussed how the process of introspection and reflection (especially expressed through writing) can have a positive impact on one's life, outlook, and health. We shared our different journal-ing practices and many of us expressed the desire to write more. I know of at least one "journaling" date that has resulted from this salon. Hopefully a good reminder of the power of introspection and self-analysis! After this discussion, we watched, on the recommendation of several salon attendees, the Ali Wong Netflix Special. This HILARIOUS hour-long show features 7.5-month-pregnant Ali Wong talking about everything from going to the bathroom at work to her marriage. Funny, apropos to being a woman in American right now, and highly recommended!</p>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #48 - 5/31/17</h3>
    <p>We kicked off this intimate salon by introducing ourselves and sharing something interesting that we had recently read or been thinking about. These topics ranged from IUDs to Netflix binge-watching to santuary cities. After these introductions, we were lucky to have Lydia share tips, tricks, and anecdotes from her two (!!!) cross-country bike trips. We learned about everything from how to do laundry and find showers on the road, to safety considerations, to communicating with your fellow riders when you don't have cell reception (leave chalk messages on the road!). Lydia did both trips with <a href="https://bikeandbuild.org/" target="_blank">Bike and Build</a>, an organization that raises money and awareness for affordable housing causes. It was fun to hear about her experiences, very informative (as I am at least tentatively thinking about doing some bike touring trips), and super inspiring!</p>

    <h3>Salon #49 - 6/28/17</h3>
    <p>This salon was salvaged by Snoweria's proactivity - I had just returned from a vacation, and didn't know if I'd be able to pull off planning/ hosting a salon...Snoweria texted me the day before, asking if salon was still "on", offering to bring a reading, and suggesting a friend who might want to present. You guys saved salon this week and it was lovely! It was also a treat to have my Dutch roommate Juliette in attendance. We started things off with a reading by Snoweria, who read a section of Rachel Maddow's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Drift-Unmooring-American-Military-Power/dp/0307460991" target="_blank">Drift</a>. The book discusses the "unmooring of american military power", and the passage she read was about some of mistakes the U.S. military has made with nuclear weapons and testing. The mistakes were as alarming as the delivery was hilarious. Discussion ranged from our country's history of nuclear mistakes (calling to mind the Environmental Politics and Law class at Yale that several of us had taken) to our respective cultural approaches to the military (we had, in attendance, those who had grown up in China/ Canada, the Netherlands, France, and a variety of spots within the U.S.). After this discussion, we were very lucky to have Snoweria's friend Sydnor present on her art practice. A trained architect, she maintains an active drawing and sketching practice. Her work involves producing generative multimedia sketches that incorporate the visual language of architecture and civil engineering. They range in size from tiny (the back of a business card) to huge canvases that she works on at a rotating table. Syndor brought in some of her "grid" drawings - large drawings where she freehands a grid design - which were very impressive to see in person!</p>

    <h3>Salon #50 - 7/26/17</h3>
    <p>For our last salon of the summer, we were thrilled to host Mary Perkins, an experienced financial advisor with more than 17 years of experience, who started her own advising practice. Many thanks to Kate Taylor-Mighty for making this connection. Mary talked with us about strategies for managing our day-to-day and week-to-week cash flow, and also about investing and retirement savings. We also learned about Mary's experience becoming a financial advisor and starting her own firm. Our conversation was very useful, and apt for many of us at this stage of life. Mary made the information fun, interesting, and approachable - thank you, Mary!</p>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #51 - 9/26/17</h3>
    <p>The first salon of the fall was a big success! We had a few new faces, and two very interesting conversations. Hannah read a long excerpt from Gregory David Roberts' <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shantaram-Novel-Gregory-David-Roberts/dp/0312330537" target="_blank">Shantaram</a>, an imaginitive, beautifully-wrought, semi-autobiographical story about India. It was fun to hear the prose itself, which seems engaging and well-written. The book also led us to a discussion of redemption, and the portrayal of other countries in literature. After the reading, Ariel gave a wonderful presentation on her summer internship at NASA JPL. We learned about the project she worked on during her internship (writing test procedures for a sensor on the Mars2020 rover!) as well as about life at NASA in general, and some of their "Greatest Hits". It was fun to hear how she is planning to bring some of these ideas back to the Media Lab!</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #52 - 10/11/17</h3>
    <p>It was fun to see a few new faces at the salon this week. I started the evening by reading Gemma Hartley's Harper's Bazaar article about emotional labor: "<a href="http://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a12063822/emotional-labor-gender-equality/" target="_blank">Women Aren't Nags - We're Just Fed Up</a>". The humorous essay made a lot of good points about how women are expected to silently bear the brunt of planning, "taking care of things", and "figuring things out". Almost all of us could relate to the dynamic described in the essay, either from experiences in our own relationships or from observing our parents. We agreed to send the article to one or more of the men in our lives, and report back. After this discussion, Snoweria shared her experience attending an <a href="http://dusp.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT DUSP</a> panel about 
    shared-income communities (aka "communes"). Several commune-dwellers had come to MIT to share information about their communities, which ranged from small, urban communities that pooled their incomes from outside jobs, to larger, rural intentional communities (like <a href="https://www.twinoaks.org/" target="_blank">Twin Oaks</a>) that are more insulated. We discussed whether or not we would want to live in communes and what elements of the model were appealing to us. Though none of us were interested in such an extreme model, we found that we do enjoy certain elements of these communities in our own lives.</p>

    <h3>Salon #53 - 10/25/17</h3>
    <p>We were delighted to host Elizabeth Christoforetti, a designer and entrepreneur, for an intimate salon discussion this week. Elizabeth is a former colleague of several of us (I met her when we both worked in the Social Computing Group at the MIT Media Lab), and has always impressed me with her sense of initiative and the work she has done to build a unique and interesting career. She graduated from the Harvard Graduate School of Design, then worked at an urban planning and architecture firm before coming to the Media Lab, and eventually starting her own company, <a href="https://www.supernormal.io/about/" target="_blank">Supernormal</a>, which takes a uniquely data-driven approach to thinking about urban spaces and challenges. We enjoyed hearing about her experience as a woman in architecture, about how she balances entrepreneurship and family, about the specific work of her company, and about how she decided to found a start-up in the first place. Thank you for your insights, Elizabeth! </p>

    <h3>Salon #54 - 11/8/17</h3>
    <p>We had a big and lively salon this past week, with a few new faces. We started the evening with a bit of an impromptu discussion about voting, since salon was the night after Election Day. Luckily, there were many more happy outcomes from the 2017 election than the 2016 one. Lydia had worked on Sumbul Siddiqui's campaign for Cambridge City Councilor (Sumbul was elected!) and was able to provide some particularly interesting insights. Next, Steph read aloud Zeynep Tufekci's <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/zeynep_tufekci_we_re_building_a_dystopia_just_to_make_people_click_on_ads" target="_blank">TED talk on the US' AI-powered information dystopia</a>. The talk describs how powerful technology companies are collecting large troves of data on their users, and using that data not only for targeted advertising, but also for changing opinions and influencing politics. It was an interesting and disturbing talk; many of us are aware of this phenomenon, and can appreciate both the benefits and risks of allowing such extensive data collection. We grappled with questions about the appropriate response of tech companies and governments, and while we didn't come up with any "silver bullet" answers, it was a thought-provoking and useful discussion. We finished out the evening with a great reading from Aviva, who read Carmen Maria Machado's (long) short story, <a href="https://granta.com/the-husband-stitch/" target="_blank">The Husband Stitch</a>. Written in the style of oral folklore, Machado tells the story of an unnamed woman's upbringing and marriage. The story starts a conversation about women's control over their own bodies and their own pleasure, and about the struggle to be taken seriously. It's a great read, and I encourage you to check it out!</p>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #55 - 11/29/17</h3>
    <p>Our last salon of the calendar year led us to some very interesting philosophical inquiry and discussion. We started the night with a reading from Aspen, who shared Mary Ruefle's <a href="http://poems.com/special_features/prose/essay_ruefle.php" target="_blank">Kangaroo Beach</a> essay. The essay discusses the roles of irreverence and sincerity in creating art, specifically poetry. We discussed the meanings of these terms, how they work in opposition and in concert, how they might apply to our own work, and how they might be more or less applicable in different fields. It was interesting to consider these attitudes as frameworks for approaching scientific or creative efforts. After this discussion, Juliana read a passage from Camus' <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Sisyphus-Other-Essays/dp/0679733736" target="_blank">The Myth of Sisyphys and Other Essays</a>. The passage suggests the pursuit of art as a way to fill the meaningless void of life. Though I have very limited knowledge of formal philosophy, it was thought-provoking (if somewhat unsettling) to think about these types of questions, interesting to relate Juliana's reading to Aspen's, and a treat to hear those more knowledgeable about philosophy discuss the different schools of thought. We rounded out the evening with some quick discussion about the acceptability of hosting a "single-gender" event, and asking when/ why/ how it is acceptable to separate groups of people based on attributes over which they have no control (e.g. gender, race, intelligence, strength, etc). </p>
</div>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #56 - 1/24/18</h3>
    <p>We had a large and lively group for the first salon of 2018! We spent some time catching up on our lives, before diving into some great readings and conversations. First, Hannah read us an excerpt from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tao-Pooh-Benjamin-Hoff/dp/0140067477" target="_blank">The Tao of Pooh</a>, a book that uses the characters and style of the Winnie the Pooh story to explain Taoism. The book presents an optimistic attitude about the world and encouraged us to adopt a simple and positive view of the world. We veered from discussion of the book into a conversation about environmentalism (one of my New Year's Goals is to improve my personal sustainability), with people offering different ideas for improving sustainability: composting, switching to clean energy, buying carbon offset credits, becoming a vegetarian, or banning cars from cities!!! The group disagreed over what attitude to take towards climate change, though. Should we be optimistic about our own small personal efforts to be sustainable, or angry/ pessimistic about the institutionalized forces that have led us to the brink of climate disaster? In the end, informed by our thoughts on the Tao of Pooh, we figured it would be best to balance these impulses of optimism and pessimism -- to not be discouraged by the enormity of the problem, but also to fight for real, widespread change.</p>
    <p>After this discussion, Lydia led us through a whirlwind tour of the history of Islam, the Quran, and Shari'a. She had taken a J-term class at Harvard on the topic, and we were very grateful that she wanted to share with us! We learned about the writing of the Quran and the diverse ways that different scholarly groups had come to concieve of the rules and norms of Islamic society. One of the most interesting ideas to me was the idea of a "maximalist" society that must explicitly state which behaviors are permissible (instead of only banning certain behaviors). We discussed how there are many new situations (enabled by technology, globalism, etc) that are not necessarily covered in the original Islam texts. Lydia shared some amusing and interesting "fatwas" (answers to questions about proper Islamic behavior) that concern marketing through Amazon or praying on a 12-hour transcontinental flight. The discussion left me feeling like I have a lot more to learn (especially at this point in history!) - but I was happy for the approachable and engaging presentation from Lydia.</p>

    <h3>Salon #57 - 2/7/18</h3>
    <p>Lydia kicked off the evening by reading <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/07/the-political-sociopath" target="_blank">The Political Sociopath</a>, a 2016 book review from Current Affairs that discusses Ted Cruz' autobiography. The review was very funny, but asked serious questions about ambition and ethics. For example, the piece wonders if political ambition is antithetical to true public service. The review was generally skeptical of politicians, and used the text of Cruz' autobiography to make the argument that Cruz is particularly unlikeable. We didn't feel that the review was a fair assessment of all politicians, but did think it made compelling points about many people with political leanings. After discussing the book review, Snoweria gave a fascinating presentation about her lab, <a href="http://senseable.mit.edu/"  target="_blank">Senseable Cities</a>. The group, made up of architects, designers, and engineers, has worked on a range of interesting projects involving sensors, technology, and cities. For example, in one project, they attached sensors to trash to visualize how far our trash travels after we throw it away. Snoweria herself is working on a cool project to bring autonomous, multi-fuctional boats to Amsterdam. The lab produces creative, interesting, and beautiful work, and we all enjoyed getting to hear about it!</p>

    <h3>Salon #58 - 2/21/18</h3>
    <p>Kat E. read an excerpt from science and EU politics journalist Leigh Phillips' <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Austerity-Ecology-Collapse-Porn-Addicts-Progress/dp/1782799605" target="_blank">Austerity Ecology and the Collapse-Porn Addicts</a>. The author offers counter-arguments to much of the mainstream, long-term thinking around the Earth's "carrying capacity" (i.e. the idea that there is a maximum population that the Earth can sustain, that we are rapidly approaching that maximum, and that we will need to do something to mitigate our population growth). He also makes arguments against the ideas of localism and eco-sustainability. Instead, he argues for a top-down democratically planned economy, and believes that we will be able to innovate our way out of the climate crisis. This was a very interesting reading that challenged many of our closely-held ideas about sustainability, and led to a discussion about "techno-optimism" and a critique of the logic in Phillips' book. This <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/opinion/sunday/tyranny-convenience.html" target="_blank">NYT article about convenience</a> was also mentioned in the context of this conversation. </p><p>

After this discussion, Aviva gave a great presentation about nutrition controversies in the news, talking about the flaws in the studies that have led to headlines like "Butter is Back" (NYT). She spoke about saturated fat and heart disease (saturated fat, like butter and coconut oil, is unfortunately bad for you!), and sodium and hypertension (too much sodium is also bad for you!). Aviva says that if you have nutrition questions about what to eat to be healthy or if you read a nutrition article online that you're not sure is true, you should check out <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/" target="_blank">Nutrition Source</a>, which is written by the Harvard School of Public Health, and cites scientific research behind their recommendations. (this write-up is adapted from Aviva's notes - thanks Aviva!)</p>

    <h3>Salon #59 - 3/7/18</h3>
    <p>We had a teeny but lovely group for salon this week! With just 3 of us, we had a wide-ranging, freeform conversation about ethnography, the Phillipines, balance, love letters, and more. It was a treat to share the evening with you ladies!</p>
</div>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #60 - 4/11/18</h3>
    <p>It was lovely to get together with the ladies of salon after nearly a month off! We were lucky to have Genevieve present three Tracy K. Smith poems to us: <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/92046/semi-splendid" target="_blank">Semi-Splendid</a>, <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/55521/i-dont-miss-it" target="_blank">I Don't Miss It</a>, and <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/55519/my-god-its-full-of-starsMy God, It's Full of Stars" target="_blank">My God, It's Full of Stars</a>. It was a nice setting to discuss poetry - it felt like we could discuss the poems without needing to come to a definite answer. Smith's poems present an interesting mix of nostalgia and humor, abstraction and concreteness. We were particularly taken with some of the imagery in the third part of My God, It's Full of Stars. After our poetry discussion, we had the pleasure of hearing from Aviva, who read us some excerpts from Italo Calvino's beautiful and whimsical book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Cities-Italo-Calvino/dp/0156453800" target="_blank">Invisible Cities</a>. The book is presented as a conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, where Marco Polo tells abstract stories about different fantastic cities (which may be metaphors for Venice - or any city that feels close to your heart). We loved hearing the excerpts and I certainly feel inspired to read the whole book! To end the night, we watched Janelle Monae's excellent new music video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaYvlVR_BEc" target="_blank">PYNK</a>, which had come out earlier in the day. </p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #61 - 4/25/18</h3>
    <p>Following in the footsteps of our previous salon, we got another great dose of poetry, this time presented by the lovely Kat E, who brought us four Ted Hughes poems: <a href="https://www.poetryarchive.org/poem/thought-fox" target="_blank">The Thought Fox</a>, <a href="https://sharkpackpoetry.com/2012/10/22/poem-ted-hughes-the-horses/" target="_blank">The Horses</a>, <a href="https://www.poetryarchive.org/poem/pike" target="_blank">Pike</a>, and <a href="http://www.theartdivas.com/2016/09/apple-tragedy-by-ted-hughes.html" target="_blank">Apple Tragedy</a>. While the first three deal with the power, violence, and mystery of nature, the fourth, from Hughes' <a href="http://thetedhughessociety.org/crow/" target="_blank">Crow series</a>, is a darkly comical and irreverent take on the Genesis story. Kat read us several other poems from Crow, and we had a lively discussion about who the Crow character might be and what motivates him. It's so fun to discuss poetry with this group! Afterwards, we transitioned nicely into a discussion on <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/audre-lorde" target="_blank">Audre Lorde</a> led by Kat D's friend Tegan (who very bravely offered to present even though she was only visiting and had never been to salon before). Tegan read to us from Lorde's essay on the Erotic and Pornographic, which posits those terms not exclusively as sexual, but as broader terms that can describe an essential feminine power (the "erotic") vs the exploitative, capitalistic, heteronormative, patriarchal society (the "pornographic"). We enjoyed a discussion on what the erotic means to us (my favorite description was as a "flow state"), whether it can be shared between people, and whether it's exclusively feminine. We ended the evening with another showing of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaYvlVR_BEc" target="_blank">PYNK</a>, which we all agreed was "erotic" in the sense Lorde had meant. Another fun fact from the evening: "yonic" is the female counterpart to "phallic".</p>

    <h3>Salon #62 - Paper Crafts Party - 5/21/18</h3>
    <p>We had a lovely "paper crafts" salon after a somewhat longer hiatus from our meetings. It was a very well-attended salon and it was fun to have a couple of new faces among us! We were lucky to have Aviva's sister, Marina, give a fascinating presentation on origami. Marina herself is an amazing origamist who has designed her own origami models, makes her own origami paper, and is writing a book on origami! We specifically learned about unit origami, which involves building multiple identical origami models that make up a larger shape, like a tessellation. Marina lead us through building several simple unit origami shapes, and then we were "let loose" to try following origami patterns from some of the many books she had brought. I had just finished my semester and took the opportunity to attempt some fun baking projects: an <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013089-almond-cake-with-cardamom-and-pistachio" target="_blank">almond cake</a> from the NYT, <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/2010/10/buckeyes/" target="_blank">buckeyes</a> (recipe from Smitten Kitchen), and <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/nigella-lawson/eton-mess-recipe-1937474" target="_blank">Eton Mess</a> (which I had recently discovered at Flour Bakery). Happily, they were all well-received! It was a fun + lively evening!</p>
</div>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #63 - 6/6/18</h3>
    <p>We had a fun salon this week that was coincidentally themed around adventure! At the start of the evening, Snoweria was telling us about her upcoming artist's residency in Banff (cool!) and how she was excited/ nervous to spend time there as she hadn't done much "outdoorsy" stuff. By coincidence, our reading for the evening, brought and read by Hannah, was an account of an extreme outdoors adventure called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30145126-the-lost-city-of-the-monkey-god" target="_blank">The Lost City of the Monkey God</a>. The book chronicles the search for a legendary long-lost city in a remote, dangerous, and untouched part of Honduras. A group of American and British adventurers, cued by LIDAR data, set out to find it, and encounter all kinds of dangers and adventures. The book was fun to hear read aloud, but also brought up some interesting questions about the ethics of exploration and archaelogical excavation. Some of the themes of the book reminded me of discussions we had in Egypt about exploration and ownership. We also decided that we should do a salon hike sometime this summer!</p>
</div>

    <h3>Salon #64 - 6/27/18</h3>
    <p>A fun salon with interesting and challenging conversation. Thank you to Hannah for the delicious peanut butter cookies and banana bread! Jenny kicked things off by reading several excerpts from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Whipping-Girl-Transsexual-Scapegoating-Femininity/dp/1580056229" target="_blank">Whipping Girl</a>, Julia Serano's manifesto on transgender discrimination and sexism. The author is a transgender woman, lesbian, and trained biologist who writes about how oppositional sexism and hierarchichal sexism (i.e. the ideas that masculinity and femininity are opposite and separate concepts, and our society's insistence on elevating masculine qualities above feminine ones) contribute to transgender sexism. Serano's clear and sometimes almost clinical writing style led us to discussion on the possibility of a post-gender world (is this something we would even want?), a brainstorm on essentially feminine experiences and challenges, and the ways in which various civil rights movements have helped or hindered each other. Snoweria posed the idea of gender one day being like hair color -- you're born with a specific one, and some people will choose to leave it alone while others change it, but people won't make a big deal of someone who has changed their gender. After this very interesting discussion (and thanks to Jenny for doing a great job leading it!), we had a shorter discussion on the litany of recent Supreme Court decisions and the news that Justice Kennedy was retiring. In short; some Court decisions may be made on legal instead of moral or ethical terms, and may be more narrow than they seem, even if they weren't the outcome we were hoping for; it's very disappointing that Kennedy is retiring, and we hope that Democrats will be able to take vocal role in determining the new justice.</p>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #65 - 7/11/18</h3>
    <p>We had a lovely salon with a few new faces. To kick things off, I read the first ~20 pages of Naomi Alderman's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Naomi-Alderman/dp/0316547611" target="_blank">The Power</a>. The book imagines a world in which women discover they have the power to discharge electrical energy from their fingertips, which they can use to protect themselves or inflict pain on others. The book, set roughly contemporarily, explores how this newfound capability to cause pain shifts the gender power dynamic. We discussed parallels between the book's imagined world and our own world, and reflected on how the book sheds light on the current gender status quo. We also talked about ways we generate or express power ourselves, in our own lives. After the book discussion, Aviva shared her experience taking an Insight Meditation class at the nearby <a href="https://cambridgeinsight.org/" target="_blank">Cambridge Insight Meditation Center</a>. She told us about her daily meditation challenges, and read some Buddhist teachings explaining how stress/ pain comes as much from unfortunate events as from how we respond to them. I particularly liked her teacher's challenge to think of 3 things you are grateful for at the beginning of each day, and at the end of the day, to forgive one person, and to forgive yourself for one thing. My life feels increasingly full of distraction, so the reminder to be mindful and present was interesting and important!</p>

    <h3>Salon Hike - 7/21/18</h3>
    <p>We had an awesome group of seven (including a few new faces) for a beautiful ~7 mile hike to and from the top of Mt. Monadnock in Vermont. It was warm but not scorching and we took the slightly longer but much-less-crowded Birchtoft trail to the top of the mountain (instead of the popular White Dot trail). The trail starts with rolling shaded hills, transitions into a steep scramble, and ends with an extended ramble across large expanses of exposed rock near the top of Monadnock. One or two people in our group had never been hiking before so this was a fun way to introduce them to a favorite pastime. On the way back, we stopped at a farm stand in MA and picked up some yummy fresh produce!</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #66 - 8/1/18</h3>
    <p>We are moving later this month(!) so salon attendees had to contend with a messier-than-usual apartment full of boxes. In lieu of a reading/ presentation this time, we watched a 1.5 hour Netflix documentary called <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80170862" target="_blank">The Bleeding Edge</a> (which had been recommended by Aviva). The dramatic and unsettling documentary examines the lax regulatory environment behind FDA medical device approval and the corporate cover-ups and lobbying activity that contribute to the use of so many unsafe devices in the U.S. In particular, the documentary covered Essure (a permanent female sterilization device), vaginal mesh implants, cobalt hip replacements, and hysterectomies made using the DaVinci robot. Many of the devices covered in the documentary affected women specifically, which led us to a brief discussion on how women and women's pain are not always believed in the medical world. Though the device companies profiled in the film <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/20/health/bayer-essure-birth-control.html" target="_blank">claimed the concerns were overblown</a>, it was an incredibly sobering and frightening look at the current state of our regulatory system. It's a quick watch, and while not exactly light-hearted, quite important.</p>
</div>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #67 - 8/29/18</h3>
    <p>This was the first salon at our new place, and it was really nice to host people there! We met outside (because our new living room is still full of boxes). It was nice to relax and cool down after what had been a 90+ degree day. Kat D. read to us from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chez-Panisse-Cookbook-Alice-Waters/dp/0679758186" target="_blank">Chez Panisse Menu Cookbook</a>, which had beautiful musings on how we should think about food itself, the community and social aspects of eating, and the process and ethics of agriculture. It was inspiring to hear! Kat also told us about her mother's whole-grain, hand-milled wheat project. The rest of our conversation ranged from how to create a healthier food and agriculture system to medical school and health insurance. Looking forward to more evenings of fun and interesting conversation in our new place! </p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #68 - 9/12/18</h3>
    <p>For our second salon at our new place (and the first in our newly set up living room!), we watched a modern dance performance brought to us by Grace (who has way more of a foot in the modern art world than the rest of us!). One of Grace's college instructors is friends with the founders of <a href="https://www.canopycanopycanopy.com/" target="_blank">Triple Canopy</a>, an art magazine that investigates different topics through artwork and performances in difference media. Their current issue interrogates the idea of sickness and health, and one of the pieces in the issue was a modern art performance choreographed and performed by Michelle Boule. We were able to livestream the performance, which was called <a href="https://www.canopycanopycanopy.com/contents/if-our-bodies-are-beyond-logic" target="_blank">If Our Bodies Are Beyond Logic</a>. The 40-minute piece consisted of improvised dance and sound as the performers tried to use movement to get "out of their heads" and participate in the process of healing. It was not a type of art that I particularly familiar or comfortable with, but it was nice to experience it in a friendly environment, and to be able to discuss it with an expert (thanks, Grace!). </p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #69 - 10/3/18</h3>
    <p>The weather is getting cooler, which makes salon feel quite cozy! We started the evening with a reading from Aviva, who read passages from Esther Perel's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mating-Captivity-Unlocking-Erotic-Intelligence/dp/0060753641" target="_blank">Mating in Captivity</a>. The book explores the relationship between intimacy and sex in long-term relationships, and relationships that involve children. Many of us could relate to the material in the book and it gave us some interesting ideas to think about and discuss. After this reading, we were lucky to have a wonderful gardening lesson from plant whisperer Ariel. We discussed best practices for watering, lighting, and fertilizing indoor houseplants, along with a grab-bag of other gardening topics, including bonsai trees, tulips, and orchids! We were thrilled to hear from Ariel and will return to our indoor plants with renewed vigor and new knowledge!</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #70 - 10/17/18</h3>
    <p>The Election Edition! Given the upcoming election, Kat D. suggested we do an election-themed salon where we discussed the different ballot initiatives and races on the MA ballot. We sent out a spreadsheet with the different initiatives and major races (in MA, there are just 3 ballot initiatives) and had different people sign up for each proposition. At salon, we spent 10-20 min discussing each initiative, as well as a few minutes discussing the race for Governor (Baker v. Gonzalez). For each race, we talked about the issue at hand, arguments for either side, and who was funding each side of each issue. Although there are no particularly controversial races in MA this year, it was useful to become informed on what we'll see on the ballot in a few weeks! <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/" target="_blank">Ballotpedia</a> and <a href="https://commonwealthmagazine.org/" target="_blank">Commonwealth Magazine</a> were two useful resources for us. Also, Kat D. came over for a fun baking extravaganza beforehand; we made <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/2012/10/apple-mosaic-tart-with-salted-caramel/" target="_blank">apple tart</a> and <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/2016/10/pumpkin-bread/" target="_blank">squash bread</a> for salon, both of which were delicious!</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="salon">
    <h3>Salon #71 - 11/28/18</h3>
    <p>After a longer-than-usual hiatus from salon (Thanksgiving, travel, life, etc), we had a bigger-than-ever-before (15 people!) salon gathering with several new faces! It's always fun to welcome new people into the fold. We kicked things off with a reading from a new friend from MIT, who mentioned that her background of studying poetry often conflicts with the more scientific, technical language used at MIT. She brought readings from three different books to explore this idea: <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/9677.html" target="_blank">The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Triggering-Town-Lectures-Essays-Writing/dp/039333872X" target="_blank">The Triggering Town</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-utmost-purple-rim-Somaliland/dp/B000866V4U" target="_blank">Beyond the Utmost Purple Rim</a>. The first reading explored the history of the concepts of science and poetry, and talked about when these concepts diverged. The second reading spoke to the idea that you need to experience new things and places to understand the environment that you came from. The final reading was an example of a straightfoward story (nonfiction!) told in flowery, beautiful prose. Following the readings, we had a wide-ranging conversation about different types of language, changes in the way we describe our surroundsings, and the idea that bias can be built into even the most scientifc publication (e.g. a description of how eggs are fertilized!)<br><br>Afterwards, we were extremely lucky to hear a performance and presentation from salon member <a href="https://www.rosehegele.com/" target="_blank">Rose Hegele</a>, who is a highly accomplished vocalist. Rose performs what is variously called "new music", "contemporary music", or "unpopular music" (her term!). She gave two short vocal performances that were unlike anything I have ever heard before; composed of onomatopoeias and new sounds, the performances were alternatively melodic, theatrical, and bizarre. Rose also spent some time telling us about the origins of this type of music, how she learns new pieces and interprets them (the score for one of the pieces looked like a comic strip!), discussing the benefits of listening to live performances, and reflecting on the privilege of getting to engage in art on a daily basis. All in all, a huge treat to hear her performance and thoughtful reflections!</p>

    <h3>Salon Holiday Crafts Party - 12/12/18</h3>
    <p>To celebrate the end of the year and get a bit festive, we had a crafts and cookie decorating party! I made <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/39-how-to-make-sugar-cookies" target="_blank">plain sugar cookies</a> and Smitten Kitchen's <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/2007/02/green-dreams/" target="_blank">matcha shortbread cookies</a> (I love these!), along with royal icing that was way too runny! I also bought a gingerbread house kit from Whole Foods that people decorated with mixed results - fun concept but the icing was also too runny. In addition to these sweets, we made a few holiday crafts: <a href="http://www.thisheartofmineblog.com/2013/11/26/felt-christmas-tree-ornament/" target="_blank">felt Christmas trees</a> (super cute), <a href="https://www.livecrafteat.com/craft/homemade-christmas-tree-star-ornaments/" target="_blank">yarn-wrapped stars</a> (fun + easy!), <a href="http://aehomestylelife.com/2014/11/20/trim-tree-blog-hop/" target="_blank">recycled paper stars</a>, classic paper snowflakes, and glittery round ornaments. It was lovely to see so many people in a relaxed setting before the end of the year, and I appreciate everyone's creativity and contributions to making our house more festive! I also retrofitted the origami we had made in May as Christmas ornaments by adding an "ornament cap" at the top of each piece so that they could be hung up on the tree. I loved that all our Christmas ornaments were handmade this year!</p>

    <h3>Salon #72 - 2/6/19</h3>
    <p>It was lovely to convene a salon group after a longer-than-usual hiatus over IAP. After introductions, Snoweria read us excerpts from Ernest Renan's 1882 essay <a href="http://ucparis.fr/files/9313/6549/9943/What_is_a_Nation.pdf" target="_blank">What is a Nation?</a>. The essay explored national identities and how they are formed, variously discussing race, religion, geography, and shared history. It was interesting to consider Renan's essay in light of 2019 America. After the reading, Andrea and I shared some photos from our Colombia trip, and told about the communities we had worked with and the projects we developed there.</p>
